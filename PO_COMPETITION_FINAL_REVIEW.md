**Company A**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
- Identified **all major gaps** with specific file paths and line numbers
- The "stub validation time bomb 💣" metaphor is perfect and memorable
- Excellent risk assessment (what breaks when, probability estimates)
- Deep dive into cost model scalability (100K users = $10M/month LLM costs)
- **Standout**: Technical risk section with Week 1-4 failure predictions

**Company B**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
- Covered all critical gaps but with less technical detail
- Production-ready foundation vs product distinction is excellent

3. Document stub validation limitation clearly (1 hour)
4. Write competitive comparison table (4 hours)
5. Update messaging to "Database Incident Copilot (Beta)" (1 hour)

**Week 2-4** (Company B's validation framework):
1. Recruit 3-5 design partners (Postgres-heavy startups)
2. Measure baseline MTTR (manual investigations)
3. Run 20 real investigations with COMPASS
4. Collect brutal feedback daily
5. Decide: Ship broader or pivot?

**Month 2-3** (Company A's technical roadmap IF validated):
1. Implement real validation strategies (not stub)
2. Add Network Agent (if design partners ask for it)
