# COMPASS

**Comprehensive Observability Multi-Agent Platform for Adaptive System Solutions**

AI-powered incident investigation platform that reduces MTTR by 67-90% using parallel OODA loops, ICS principles, and scientific methodology.

---

## What is COMPASS?

**The Problem**: Traditional incident investigation tools require senior engineers to manually connect dots between metrics, logs, and traces. Average MTTR: 2-4 hours. Knowledge concentrated in a few experts.

**The Solution**: COMPASS uses AI agents with scientific methodology to systematically test hypotheses in parallel, filtering out noise and presenting only high-confidence root causes to humans.

**Key Differentiators**:
- 🧪 **Scientific rigor**: Systematic hypothesis disproof (not just pattern matching)
- ⚡ **Parallel OODA loops**: 5+ agents testing simultaneously (10x faster than sequential)
- 🤖 **Bring your own LLM**: OpenAI, Anthropic, or any provider (cost-controlled)
- 👥 **Learning Teams approach**: Focus on contributing causes, not blame
- 💰 **Cost-aware**: $10/investigation routine, $20 critical (transparent budgets)

**Current Status**: Production-grade foundation ready for Database Agent implementation

## Core Concepts

### What is COMPASS?

COMPASS uses AI agents organized according to Incident Command System (ICS) principles to investigate incidents using parallel OODA loops and scientific methodology.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Parallel OODA Loops**: 5+ agents test hypotheses simultaneously
- **Scientific Rigor**: Systematic hypothesis disproof before human escalation
- **Learning Culture**: Learning Teams methodology vs traditional RCA
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Level 1 autonomy - AI proposes, humans decide

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python only (readability over complexity)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Observability**: LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir)
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes (Tilt for local dev)
- **LLM**: Provider agnostic (OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, Ollama)

### Architecture Highlights

**Agent Hierarchy** (ICS-based):
```
Orchestrator
    ├── Database Manager → Workers
    ├── Network Manager → Workers
    ├── Application Manager → Workers
    └── Infrastructure Manager → Workers
```

**OODA Loop Phases**:
1. **Observe**: Parallel data gathering
2. **Orient**: Hypothesis generation and ranking
3. **Decide**: Human decision points
4. **Act**: Evidence gathering and hypothesis testing
