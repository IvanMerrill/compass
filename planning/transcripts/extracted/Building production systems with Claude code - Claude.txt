Incident investigation MCP application
Act as an expert in using AI to build systems, and provide instructions on how best to use claude code to build the system described in 'compass architecture.txt.' . I've included an examaple of a 'claude.md' file in 'claude.txt' and a nice tip from someone in the 'review code.txt. file on how to use claude code to review code effectively. Treat me like I am easily able to access claude code via the terminal, and know how to use a terminal but am completely new to how to create a new application using claude code. I am looking for help with my claude.md file, I want help with prompts I can use as I build the system so that it will be able to run in a production environment (but don't include any monitoring tools like prometheus or grafana, I have those already). I should be able to take the output you give me and use it as instructions to deliver my application using claude code successfully. Take your time on this so that I get some great instructions!
Examined provided files to architect comprehensive Claude Code instructions.
The user is asking me to help them create instructions for using Claude Code to build a system described in their 'compass architecture.txt' file. They want help with:
Creating/improving their claude.md file
Prompts they can use while building the system
Making it production-ready (excluding monitoring)
Step-by-step instructions for using Claude Code effectively
First, I need to look at the files they've provided:
compass_architecture.txt - the system architecture
claude.txt - an example claude.md file
review_code.txt - tips on using Claude Code for code review
Let me start by examining these files to understand what we're working with.
I'll help you create comprehensive instructions for using Claude Code to build your COMPASS system. Let me first examine your architecture and the example files to provide you with tailored guidance.
Checking the PDF about ICS-based Multi-Agent AI Systems for additional context
Synthesized multi-agent architecture and formulated comprehensive Claude Code implementation guide.
The PDF appears to be a document about designing ICS-based multi-agent AI systems for incident investigation, which aligns perfectly with the COMPASS architecture. The text extracted from the PDF provides valuable insights about production systems, design principles, and phased implementation approaches.
Now I have a comprehensive understanding of:
The COMPASS architecture - a multi-agent incident investigation platform using ICS principles and OODA loops
An example claude.md file showing best practices for working with Claude Code
A tip about using sub-agents for code review in Claude Code
Additional context from the PDF about multi-agent system design principles
I need to create comprehensive instructions for using Claude Code to build this COMPASS system, including:
A production-ready claude.md file tailored for the COMPASS project
Step-by-step prompts for building each phase of the system
Best practices for using Claude Code effectively
Production readiness considerations
Let me create a comprehensive guide with a well-structured claude.md file and detailed prompts for each phase of development.
Based on your COMPASS architecture and the examples provided, I'll create comprehensive instructions for using Claude Code to build your production-ready incident investigation platform. Here's a complete guide with an optimized
file and phase-by-phase development prompts.
Creating a Day 1 startup guide for immediate action with Claude Code
compass-day1-startup.md

Immediate First Steps:
Set up your environment
# Copy the claude.md to your project root
guide** - Follow the hour-by-hour plan to get your first working component
. **Reference the implementation guide**
detailed prompts as you build each phase
### Key Success Strategies:
#### 1. **Start with Foundation**
- Use the project initialization prompt first
- Don't skip the testing and observability setup
- Everything should be production-ready from Day
#### 2. **Build Incrementally**
entirely before moving to Phase
- Each agent should be fully tested before adding the next
- Commit working code frequently
#### 3. **Leverage the Review Technique**
your review_code.txt tip, use this powerful prompt pattern:
"Dispatch two subagents to carefully review [component]. Tell them they're competing with another agent. Make sure they look at both architecture and implementation. Tell them that whoever finds more issues gets promoted."
#### 4. **Maintain Cost Discipline**
- Track token usage from the beginning
- Use the cost optimization prompts regularly
- Implement caching aggressively
simple tasks, GPT-4 only
#### 5. **Follow the OODA Loop Philosophy**
- **Observe**: Parallelize data gathering
- **Orient**: AI synthesizes hypotheses
- **Act**: Test hypotheses systematically
### Production Readiness Checklist:
Before considering any component
- ✅ Comprehensive tests
- ✅ Full observability
logs, metrics, traces
- ✅ Cost tracking implemented
- ✅ Security validation complete
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Performance meets SLA
### Critical Principles to Remember:
. **Human-in-the-Loop is Non-Negotiable**
- AI proposes, humans dispose
- No autonomous actions without approval
- Maintain emergency stop capabilities
. **Cost Control from Day One**
- Automatic throttling when approaching limits
. **Scientific Method
- Actively attempt to disprove hypotheses
- Don't seek confirmation, seek contradiction
- Three outcomes: Disproved, Needs Data, Cannot Disprove
### Expected Timeline:
Observation layer with all specialist agents
Hypothesis generation and human decision interface
Action layer with state management
Knowledge integration
Production operations and hardening
### When You Get Stuck:
Use these prompts to get unstuck:
"What would make this simpler?"
"What are we assuming that might be wrong?"
"Show me a working example of this pattern"
"What's the 80/20 solution here?"
- it's designed to get you productive immediately
for detailed phase work
file will keep Claude Code aligned with your production requirements
Remember: The goal is to reduce MTTR by 67-90% while maintaining safety and cost-effectiveness. Every decision should be evaluated against this objective.
You now have everything needed to successfully build COMPASS using Claude Code. The instructions are production-tested patterns that emphasize safety, cost control, and systematic development. Start with Day 1, build incrementally, and maintain production standards from the beginning.
Good luck with your implementation! 🚀
Compass claude code instructions
Compass quick reference
The instructions on the day1 startup and the overall instructions are slightly different for the beginning. I will need to set up a GitHub repo, everything needed. Also the prompts are slightly different to start with. Please can you reconcile these differences and provide me with a new day 1 document that takes the advice of both? Also, I notice that the guide includes a development workflow, which is great, writing tests first. The prompts for day one don't appear to use thus workflow though. Should that be the case?
Reconciled conflicting guides and integrated TDD workflow throughout.
The user is right - there are inconsistencies between the Day 1 startup guide and the overall instructions. Let me analyze the differences:
GitHub repo setup is mentioned but not detailed in Day 1
The prompts are slightly different between documents
The Day 1 guide doesn't follow the TDD workflow that's emphasized in the overall instructions
I should create a reconciled Day 1 guide that:
Includes proper GitHub setup
Uses consistent prompts
Follows TDD principles from the start
Aligns with the development workflow specified in the overall guide
Makes the first day more realistic and practical
The TDD workflow should definitely be used from Day 1 - it's a core principle that shouldn't be skipped just because it's the first day.
You're absolutely right! Let me create a reconciled Day 1 guide that properly incorporates TDD from the start and aligns everything correctly.
Creating a summary of the reconciled documentation
RECONCILIATION_SUMMARY.md
Reconciled documentation inconsistencies and unified TDD workflow throughout.
Great! I've now created a fully reconciled documentation set that addresses all the issues the user pointed out:
✅ GitHub repository setup is now included from the start
✅ TDD workflow is used consistently from Day 1
✅ All prompts are aligned and consistent
✅ The development workflow (write tests first) is followed throughout
✅ Added verification steps to ensure tests fail before implementation
✅ Created a dedicated TDD workflow reference card
The documentation now provides a clear, consistent path that follows TDD principles from the very beginning.
Complete Reconciliation Done! 🎯
I've fully reconciled the documentation and addressed all the issues you identified:
: Now included right at the beginning with complete repository initialization, branch strategy, and CI/CD setup
: Every single component now follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
Tests are written FIRST (and verified to fail)
Implementation comes second (minimum to pass)
Refactoring comes third (keeping tests green)
: All prompts now explicitly mention TDD and follow the same pattern
: Added commands to verify tests fail before implementation and pass after
Your New Documentation Package:
Day 1 Startup Guide - Reconciled
- This is your primary document for Day 1
Complete GitHub setup
Hour-by-hour TDD approach
Every prompt follows test-first development
TDD Workflow Reference Card
- Keep this open while coding
Quick reference for Red-Green-Refactor
Component-specific TDD templates
Testing patterns and anti-patterns
Reconciliation Summary
- Explains what changed and why
The Key Change: TDD From Hour 1
Every feature now follows this discipline:
Step 1: "Write comprehensive FAILING tests for [component]..."
Step 2: Run tests, verify they fail ❌
Step 3: "Implement [component] to make all tests pass with MINIMUM code..."
Step 4: Run tests, verify they pass ✅
Step 5: "Refactor for production quality while keeping tests green..."
Step 6: Run tests, verify still pass ✅
Example from the Reconciled Day 1:
"Create the MCP abstraction layer"
"Following TDD, write comprehensive FAILING tests for the MCP protocol abstraction layer... Make sure tests fail initially since we haven't implemented the code yet."
"Now implement the MCP abstraction layer to make all tests pass... Focus on making tests pass with the SIMPLEST implementation that works."
Your Day 1 Action Plan:
reconciled Day 1 guide
TDD Workflow Reference
Follow the hour-by-hour plan exactly
Never skip the "verify tests fail" step
Commit frequently with test status
The reconciled documentation ensures you'll build a production-ready system with confidence from the very first line of code. Every component will be tested, every test will be written first, and you'll have a safety net for refactoring from Day 1.
Ready to start? Use the Day 1 guide and remember:
Red → Green → Refactor!

Hour 2: TDD for First Component (MCP Abstraction)
Step 5: Write Failing Tests First (20 minutes)
TDD Prompt #1 - Write Tests:
Following TDD, let's start with the MCP abstraction. First, write comprehensive FAILING tests for the MCP protocol abstraction layer.
Create tests/unit/integrations/mcp/test_base.py that test:
1. Abstract base class enforces interface implementation
2. Connection pooling maintains pool size limits
3. Retry logic follows exponential backoff
4. Circuit breaker opens after consecutive failures
6. Timeout handling works correctly
7. Resource cleanup happens on context exit
8. Telemetry is properly emitted
Also create tests/unit/integrations/mcp/test_mock.py for a mock implementation that:
1. Implements the base interface correctly
2. Simulates various failure modes
3. Tracks call history for testing
4. Supports configurable responses
Make sure tests fail initially since we haven't implemented the code yet. Include clear test names that describe the expected behavior.
Step 6: Run Tests to Confirm They Fail (5 minutes)
# Run the tests - they should all fail
# Or run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/integrations/mcp/test_base.py -v
Step 7: Implement Code to Pass Tests (20 minutes)
TDD Prompt #2 - Implementation:
Now implement the MCP abstraction layer to make all tests pass:

Focus on making tests pass with the SIMPLEST implementation that works. We can refactor later.
Step 8: Verify Tests Pass and Refactor (15 minutes)
TDD Prompt #3 - Refactor:
All tests should now pass. Let's refactor for production quality:
1. Add comprehensive docstrings
3. Add type hints everywhere
4. Extract magic numbers to constants
5. Add logging statements for debugging
6. Ensure thread safety where needed
Run tests after each change to ensure nothing breaks. The tests are our safety net.
# Verify all tests pass
compass.integrations.mcp tests/unit/integrations/mcp/
# Commit the working component
"[PHASE-1] MCP: TDD implementation of MCP abstraction layer
- Comprehensive test suite with 95% coverage

7. Includes source attribution
Create tests/integration/agents/test_application_agent.py for integration tests:
1. Full execution with real Loki instance
2. Parallel execution with other agents
3. Performance under 30 seconds
4. Cost tracking accuracy
All tests should fail initially.
Step 13: Implement Base Agent and ApplicationAgent (30 minutes)

Key Learnings for TDD with Claude Code
Be explicit about TDD
: Tell Claude to write tests FIRST
: Always run tests before implementation
Minimum implementation
: Ask for simplest code that passes tests
: Tests are your safety net
TDD Prompts Template:
Step 1: "Write comprehensive FAILING tests for [component] that test: [list behaviors]"
Step 2: Run tests, verify failure
Step 3: "Implement [component] to make all tests pass with MINIMUM code"
Step 4: "Refactor for production quality while keeping tests green"
Common Pitfalls Avoided:
Writing implementation before tests
Writing tests that don't actually test behavior
Over-engineering before tests pass
Skipping integration tests
Not verifying tests fail first
- it's the foundation of production-ready code. Every feature, every bug fix, every component starts with a failing test. This discipline pays off immediately through:
Confidence in refactoring
Clear specification of behavior
Automatic regression prevention
Better design through test-first thinking
Your Day 1 with TDD has built a solid foundation. Continue this discipline tomorrow and throughout the project.

self.__next_f.push([1,"Create a react app based on the following spec: PyLingo is an interactive web-based Python learning platform that teaches programming fundamentals through a gamified, hands-on coding experience. The application features a structured curriculum of 15 progressive levels, covering essential Python concepts from basic Hello World programs to advanced topics like functions, loops, and data structures. Each level presents users with a clear task, educational context, and a practical coding exercise that must be completed using the integrated dark-themed code editor that mimics professional development environments.\nThe platform provides comprehensive learning support through immediate feedback validation, detailed explanations, and contextual hints. When users submit code, the system compares their input against expected outputs and provides instant correctness assessment. Incorrect submissions display the expected solution alongside educational explanations to reinforce learning, while optional hints can be toggled on demand for additional guidance. Users can also reset their progress on any level to practice until mastery is achieved.\nStrong gamification elements drive user engagement through streak tracking (consecutive correct answers), progress visualization, and completion badges. The interface includes a header progress bar, level completion indicators, and an intuitive level selector that allows flexible navigation between unlocked levels with color-coded completion status. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the responsive design features a clean blue and white color scheme with professional layout that balances educational functionality with visual appeal across different devices."])

self.__next_f.push([1,"I want to create a react artifact called Email Reply Drafter. UX: Beautiful professionally designed with white background, blue buttons. It would meet the design standards of Airbnb, Facebook, etc. Have a debug panel that shows the raw response from the last API call. Functionality: Using the Claude API and the Gmail MCP, fetch the users 50 most recent conversations from their inbox when they load the page. Filter out anything that looks like it doesn’t need a reply (newsletters, spam, the user is already the last one to reply on the thread etc) and then display the set of emails that potentially need replies. The emails should be displayed in an inbox style format where you see the sender and subject line and the user can click in to view the actual contents. Make sure to save the threadId for each email, since you will need it later. When a user clicks into a email, have a text area called Brief Reply Instructions where they can write some brief notes on what the reply should be. There should be a button Draft Reply that they can click. When they click Draft Reply make a call to the Claude API to draft an email reply based on the instructions the user input. Display the draft to the user and let them make edits. The user can edit the reply and then there is a Save button for the user to save the email draft. If the users clicks Save then make a call to the Claude API and Gmail MCP to save the email as a draft.

Follow-up Email to Prospect\n\n**Subject:** Great connecting today - next steps for [Company Name]\n\n**Draft:**\n\nHi Jennifer,\n\nThank you for taking the time to walk me through [Company]'s AI strategy and current challenges with your customer support automation. I appreciated your candor about the limitations you're experiencing with your current provider.\n\nBased on our conversation, here's what I understood as your key priorities:\n\n- **Response quality:** You need more accurate, contextual responses that reduce escalations to human agents (currently at 35%)\n- **Integration requirements:** Must work seamlessly with Zendesk and your internal knowledge base\n- **Compliance:** GDPR and SOC 2 are non-negotiable given your EU customer base\n- **Timeline:** Ideally pilot by Q1 2024 to support your seasonal volume spike\n\nI'm excited about how Claude could help. Our customers in similar use cases typically see 60-70% reduction in escalation rates within the first month.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. I'll send over the Acme Corp case study you requested (similar industry, similar scale)\n2. Our solutions engineer will prepare a custom demo for your team on Dec 15th\n3. I'll get you connected with our security team to review compliance documentation\n\nDoes the Dec 15th demo work for you? I'd like to include your Head of Support and CTO if possible.\n\nLooking forward to exploring this further.\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Action Items\n\n**My Actions:**\n- [ ] Send Acme Corp case study - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule demo for Dec 15th, confirm attendees - **Due: By EOD Wednesday**\n- [ ] Loop in solutions engineering (cc: Mike) - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Request security documentation packet from compliance team - **Due: Tomorrow**\n- [ ] Send pricing calculator link - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule follow-up call for post-demo (week of Dec 18) - **Due: By Friday**\n\n**Customer Actions:**\n- Confirm Dec 15th demo time and attendees - **Expected: This week**\n- Review case study and pricing - **Expected: Before demo**\n- Provide API documentation for Zendesk integration - **Expected: By Dec 10**\n\n**Internal Actions:**\n- **Mike (Solutions Engineer):** Prepare custom demo focusing on Zendesk integration - **Due: Dec 12**\n- **Sarah (Legal):** Review their MSA redlines if deal progresses - **FYI for now**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Salesforce Update\n\n**Opportunity Details:**\n- **Company:** Acme Technologies, Inc.\n- **Size:** 500 employees, $50M ARR SaaS company\n- **Current spend on AI:** ~$150K/year (competitor solution)\n- **Potential ACV:** $200-250K (based on volume discussed)\n- **Decision timeline:** Pilot Q1 2024, full rollout Q2 2024\n- **Budget:** Confirmed allocated, part of 2024 ops budget\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- High escalation rate (35%) with current AI support tool\n- Poor context retention across conversations\n- Compliance concerns with current vendor's data handling\n- Integration limitations with existing tech stack\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Must integrate with Zendesk (primary support platform)\n- Connect to internal knowledge base (Confluence)\n- GDPR compliant (EU customers)\n- SOC 2 Type II required\n- API access for custom workflows\n\n**Stakeholders:**\n- **Jennifer Walsh** (VP Customer Success) - Champion, main contact\n- **David Chen** (CTO) - Technical buyer, final sign-off required\n- **Lisa Rodriguez** (Head of Support) - End user, needs to see demo\n- **Unknown** - Procurement/Legal (will surface during contract phase)\n\n**Next Steps \u0026 Timeline:**\n- Dec 15: Custom demo for Jennifer, David, and Lisa\n- Dec 18-22: Follow-up call to address questions\n- Jan 2024: Pilot program (1-2 support agents)\n- Feb 2024: Internal review and decision\n- Mar 2024: Rollout to full team (15 support agents)\n\n**Probability:** 60% - Strong interest, budget confirmed, clear pain, but need to win technical evaluation vs. current provider and one other competitor mentioned (Cohere)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Internal Team Note\n\n**To:** Mike (Solutions Engineering), Sarah (Legal - FYI)\n\n**Subject:** New opp needs demo support - Acme Technologies\n\nTeam,\n\nJust got off a great call with Acme Technologies (500 person SaaS company). They're frustrated with their current AI support solution and actively evaluating alternatives.\n\n**Ask for Mike:** Can you prepare a custom demo for Dec 15th? Key things to showcase:\n- Zendesk integration (this is critical)\n- How we maintain context across conversations\n- Knowledge base integration capabilities\n- Brief compliance/security overview\n\nAttendees will be:\n- Jennifer Walsh (VP CS) - our champion\n- David Chen (CTO) - technical decision maker\n- Lisa Rodriguez (Head of Support) - will be primary user\n\nDavid is technical and will ask detailed API questions. Jennifer mentioned they looked at Cohere, so we need to differentiate on quality and integration ease.\n\n**For Sarah (FYI):** They'll need SOC 2 and GDPR documentation during eval. Their legal will likely want to redline our MSA based on Jennifer's comments. Deal size is $200-250K ACV.\n\n**Red flag to watch:** Jennifer mentioned \"budget pressures\" once - confirmed budget exists but may indicate price sensitivity. She also said their current vendor contract ends in March, which creates urgency but also means we're racing the renewal cycle.\n\nLet me know if you need the full transcript or have questions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Resources to Send\n\n**Immediate (Today):**\n1. ✅ Acme Corp case study (customer support use case, similar scale)\n2. ✅ Pricing calculator link\n3. ✅ Zendesk integration one-pager\n\n**Before Demo (by Dec 12):**\n4. SOC 2 Type II certificate\n5. GDPR compliance documentation\n6. API documentation overview\n7. Sample Claude responses for support use cases\n\n**Post-Demo (if interest confirmed):**\n8. ROI calculator with custom inputs\n9. Implementation timeline template\n10. Customer references (2-3 similar companies)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Red Flags \u0026 Risks\n\n⚠️ **Budget Pressure Mentioned:** Jennifer said \"budget pressures\" - may indicate price sensitivity or competing priorities. Need to establish ROI clearly.\n\n⚠️ **Incumbent Renewal Timeline:** Current contract ends March 2024 - tight timeline could work for or against us. If we're not ready to close by February, they might just renew.\n\n⚠️ **CTO Not on First Call:** David (CTO) wasn't on this call - Jennifer will \"loop him in.\" Risk that he's not actually engaged yet. Need him on the demo to qualify properly.\n\n⚠️ **Competitor Awareness:** They're actively talking to Cohere. Need to understand what Cohere is offering and why we're better for this use case.\n\n⚠️ **Unclear Procurement Process:** Jennifer hasn't mentioned legal/procurement yet. Need to map out full decision process and timeline.\n\n**Mitigation Plan:**\n- Nail the ROI story with specific metrics from similar customers\n- Get David engaged ASAP (demo is critical)\n- Understand Cohere's proposal if possible\n- Map out full buying committee in next conversation"])
