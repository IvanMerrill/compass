Incident investigation MCP application
In all of our conversations and all of the documents there's a lot of information about what we want want to build, how we'll evolve it and how we'll build it. I'd like to now create a high level architecture document that considers everything and plots out how to build the MVP that we can then buil
Synthesized project scope and architected comprehensive implementation framework.
This is a really important moment for Ivan. He's asking me to create a comprehensive architecture reference document that will serve as the foundation for building COMPASS. Let me think carefully about this.
He wants me to be realistic and grounded - not just agree with everything
This is an internal product document for him and Claude Code to use as they build
I need to consider everything we've discussed across all our conversations and documents
The document needs to be concrete enough to guide implementation but not include unnecessary technical details
It should reference existing architecture documents for deeper technical details
It needs to structure information so AI (Claude Code) understands the what and why before the how
This is a pivotal moment for him - he's both excited and nervous
Let me first review what we have in the project to make sure I understand the full scope:
Multiple architecture documents covering different aspects (enterprise knowledge, interface, future-proofing, etc.)
Scientific framework implementation with Python code
Product strategy and reference documents
Research papers on Learning Teams and incident investigation
I should structure this document to:
Start with clear product vision and objectives
Explain what COMPASS is and why it matters
Define the MVP scope realistically
Map out the architecture with references to detailed docs
Provide a staged implementation approach
Be honest about challenges and risks
Let me search the project knowledge to make sure I'm considering all the important details.
I understand the weight of this moment, Ivan. Let me take a comprehensive look at everything we've built together to create a solid foundation document. This is indeed a big step, and I want to help you get it right.

I cannot provide a summary because the user prompt is empty. Please provide a user prompt so I can create an appropriate summary.
Now I need to create a comprehensive architecture document that:
Provides a clear understanding for Claude Code and humans
Is realistic and grounded
Structures information from product vision to technical details
References existing documents for implementation details
Focuses on the MVP first, then stages beyond
Is concrete enough to guide implementation
Let me structure this as a high-level architecture document that serves as a foundation for building the MVP and evolving to an enterprise tool.
Start with the vision and objectives
Clearly define what COMPASS is
Outline the MVP scope realistically
Map the architecture with references to detailed docs
Keep it focused as a product document, not overly technical
Ivan, I understand this is a pivotal moment. Let me create a comprehensive architecture document that will serve as our north star for building COMPASS. I'll be realistic, direct, and focus on what we can actually achieve together.
Creating the COMPASS MVP Architecture Reference Document - a comprehensive guide for building our incident investigation platform from MVP to enterprise
COMPASS_MVP_Architecture_Reference.md
Architected comprehensive blueprint balancing vision, realism, and implementation guidance.
I've created a comprehensive architecture reference document that:
Provides clear understanding for AI and humans
- Starting with vision and problem statement before diving into technical details
- 3-month timeline with specific weekly milestones, acknowledging risks and trade-offs
- Clear scope of what's in and what's out, with concrete success metrics
References existing documents
- Points to detailed implementation docs where appropriate
Structures information logically
- From vision to implementation, making it useful as a reference
- Specific features with "done when" criteria
Maintains product focus
- Not overly technical, focuses on value and outcomes
The document is honest about challenges while maintaining optimism about what's achievable. It provides a clear path forward that Ivan and Claude Code can use to build COMPASS together.
Your Architecture Foundation is Ready
Ivan, I've created the comprehensive architecture reference document that will guide us from MVP to enterprise platform. This is your blueprint - pragmatic, focused, and achievable.
View your COMPASS MVP Architecture Reference Document
Clear product vision with staged evolution
Realistic 3-month MVP scope with weekly milestones
System architecture that leverages all our previous work
Explicit trade-offs and risk mitigation
Concrete success metrics we can track
References to detailed implementation docs where needed
Key decisions I've made for clarity:
MVP focuses purely on investigation speed and quality - no enterprise features
CLI-first approach - perfect for developer adoption
5-minute investigation target with parallel execution
$5 per investigation cost ceiling
10 beta users as initial success metric
Reality checks included:
Acknowledged that LLM hallucination is a high-probability risk
Falsification framework as our defense against bad hypotheses
Progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users
Clear "what we're NOT doing" section to maintain focus
This document is your north star. It tells Claude Code exactly what we're building and why. It gives you weekly checkpoints to track progress. Most importantly, it keeps us grounded while building something transformative.
The path is clear. The architecture is sound. Let's build COMPASS together.
Compass mvp architecture reference
This is great! Ok, now we're getting closer to building. Now let's focus on our MVP.  We have our architecture defined, what we're trying to build, as well as architecture documents that are referenced here that give us more implementation details.
Let's now iterate over these documents to come up with a more concrete design  for our MVP.
Synthesized architecture into concrete MVP implementation specifications.
Ivan wants to iterate on the documents to create a more concrete design for the MVP. We have the high-level architecture document, but now we need to get more specific about the actual implementation details for the MVP. Let me search through our project knowledge to understand what implementation details we already have and what needs to be made more concrete.
The user wants to drill down from the architecture level to actual concrete design - things like:
Configuration schemas
Let me search for existing implementation details and then create a concrete technical design document for the MVP.
Excellent! Let's drill down from architecture to concrete implementation design for the MVP. Let me review our existing implementation details and create a focused technical design.

Architected concrete MVP specifications bridging design and implementation.
Looking at what we have, I need to create a concrete technical design document for the MVP that bridges the gap between our high-level architecture and actual implementation. Let me focus on:
Specific API contracts between components
Data models and schemas
MCP integration specifics
CLI command structure
Configuration formats
State management design
Deployment configuration
I should create a document that a developer could use to start coding immediately.
Perfect! Let's create a concrete technical design document that bridges the gap between our architecture and actual implementation. This will be your blueprint for building the MVP.

Compass mvp technical design
This is great! Now, if you look at the documents, you've provided me a complete instruction set, a reference guide, a claude.md file, a day 1 instruction set and everything to get started, but these documents were built a long time ago, before we made so much progress on our design. Please now repeat this process and give me a complete set of instructions that I can use, alongside Claude code, to build this MVP for our system as per our architecture, design and technical design documents.
Please think carefully here, this is the bit where we actually start building, which is super scary for me. It's a real big moment in our project, so as I mentioned before, I need help and support overcoming this hurdle. So I'm really hoping you can give me some great instructions that I can follow that will really help us move forward with building this well. I'm hoping I can just follow the instructions to the letter and have the MVP built. So please think carefully here about how you can provide me with everything I need to go from where we are now, to a built MVP, using Claude code and getting high quality results.

self.__next_f.push([1,"Create a react app based on the following spec: PyLingo is an interactive web-based Python learning platform that teaches programming fundamentals through a gamified, hands-on coding experience. The application features a structured curriculum of 15 progressive levels, covering essential Python concepts from basic Hello World programs to advanced topics like functions, loops, and data structures. Each level presents users with a clear task, educational context, and a practical coding exercise that must be completed using the integrated dark-themed code editor that mimics professional development environments.\nThe platform provides comprehensive learning support through immediate feedback validation, detailed explanations, and contextual hints. When users submit code, the system compares their input against expected outputs and provides instant correctness assessment. Incorrect submissions display the expected solution alongside educational explanations to reinforce learning, while optional hints can be toggled on demand for additional guidance. Users can also reset their progress on any level to practice until mastery is achieved.\nStrong gamification elements drive user engagement through streak tracking (consecutive correct answers), progress visualization, and completion badges. The interface includes a header progress bar, level completion indicators, and an intuitive level selector that allows flexible navigation between unlocked levels with color-coded completion status. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the responsive design features a clean blue and white color scheme with professional layout that balances educational functionality with visual appeal across different devices."])

self.__next_f.push([1,"I want to create a react artifact called Email Reply Drafter. UX: Beautiful professionally designed with white background, blue buttons. It would meet the design standards of Airbnb, Facebook, etc. Have a debug panel that shows the raw response from the last API call. Functionality: Using the Claude API and the Gmail MCP, fetch the users 50 most recent conversations from their inbox when they load the page. Filter out anything that looks like it doesn’t need a reply (newsletters, spam, the user is already the last one to reply on the thread etc) and then display the set of emails that potentially need replies. The emails should be displayed in an inbox style format where you see the sender and subject line and the user can click in to view the actual contents. Make sure to save the threadId for each email, since you will need it later. When a user clicks into a email, have a text area called Brief Reply Instructions where they can write some brief notes on what the reply should be. There should be a button Draft Reply that they can click. When they click Draft Reply make a call to the Claude API to draft an email reply based on the instructions the user input. Display the draft to the user and let them make edits. The user can edit the reply and then there is a Save button for the user to save the email draft. If the users clicks Save then make a call to the Claude API and Gmail MCP to save the email as a draft.

Follow-up Email to Prospect\n\n**Subject:** Great connecting today - next steps for [Company Name]\n\n**Draft:**\n\nHi Jennifer,\n\nThank you for taking the time to walk me through [Company]'s AI strategy and current challenges with your customer support automation. I appreciated your candor about the limitations you're experiencing with your current provider.\n\nBased on our conversation, here's what I understood as your key priorities:\n\n- **Response quality:** You need more accurate, contextual responses that reduce escalations to human agents (currently at 35%)\n- **Integration requirements:** Must work seamlessly with Zendesk and your internal knowledge base\n- **Compliance:** GDPR and SOC 2 are non-negotiable given your EU customer base\n- **Timeline:** Ideally pilot by Q1 2024 to support your seasonal volume spike\n\nI'm excited about how Claude could help. Our customers in similar use cases typically see 60-70% reduction in escalation rates within the first month.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. I'll send over the Acme Corp case study you requested (similar industry, similar scale)\n2. Our solutions engineer will prepare a custom demo for your team on Dec 15th\n3. I'll get you connected with our security team to review compliance documentation\n\nDoes the Dec 15th demo work for you? I'd like to include your Head of Support and CTO if possible.\n\nLooking forward to exploring this further.\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Action Items\n\n**My Actions:**\n- [ ] Send Acme Corp case study - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule demo for Dec 15th, confirm attendees - **Due: By EOD Wednesday**\n- [ ] Loop in solutions engineering (cc: Mike) - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Request security documentation packet from compliance team - **Due: Tomorrow**\n- [ ] Send pricing calculator link - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule follow-up call for post-demo (week of Dec 18) - **Due: By Friday**\n\n**Customer Actions:**\n- Confirm Dec 15th demo time and attendees - **Expected: This week**\n- Review case study and pricing - **Expected: Before demo**\n- Provide API documentation for Zendesk integration - **Expected: By Dec 10**\n\n**Internal Actions:**\n- **Mike (Solutions Engineer):** Prepare custom demo focusing on Zendesk integration - **Due: Dec 12**\n- **Sarah (Legal):** Review their MSA redlines if deal progresses - **FYI for now**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Salesforce Update\n\n**Opportunity Details:**\n- **Company:** Acme Technologies, Inc.\n- **Size:** 500 employees, $50M ARR SaaS company\n- **Current spend on AI:** ~$150K/year (competitor solution)\n- **Potential ACV:** $200-250K (based on volume discussed)\n- **Decision timeline:** Pilot Q1 2024, full rollout Q2 2024\n- **Budget:** Confirmed allocated, part of 2024 ops budget\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- High escalation rate (35%) with current AI support tool\n- Poor context retention across conversations\n- Compliance concerns with current vendor's data handling\n- Integration limitations with existing tech stack\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Must integrate with Zendesk (primary support platform)\n- Connect to internal knowledge base (Confluence)\n- GDPR compliant (EU customers)\n- SOC 2 Type II required\n- API access for custom workflows\n\n**Stakeholders:**\n- **Jennifer Walsh** (VP Customer Success) - Champion, main contact\n- **David Chen** (CTO) - Technical buyer, final sign-off required\n- **Lisa Rodriguez** (Head of Support) - End user, needs to see demo\n- **Unknown** - Procurement/Legal (will surface during contract phase)\n\n**Next Steps \u0026 Timeline:**\n- Dec 15: Custom demo for Jennifer, David, and Lisa\n- Dec 18-22: Follow-up call to address questions\n- Jan 2024: Pilot program (1-2 support agents)\n- Feb 2024: Internal review and decision\n- Mar 2024: Rollout to full team (15 support agents)\n\n**Probability:** 60% - Strong interest, budget confirmed, clear pain, but need to win technical evaluation vs. current provider and one other competitor mentioned (Cohere)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Internal Team Note\n\n**To:** Mike (Solutions Engineering), Sarah (Legal - FYI)\n\n**Subject:** New opp needs demo support - Acme Technologies\n\nTeam,\n\nJust got off a great call with Acme Technologies (500 person SaaS company). They're frustrated with their current AI support solution and actively evaluating alternatives.\n\n**Ask for Mike:** Can you prepare a custom demo for Dec 15th? Key things to showcase:\n- Zendesk integration (this is critical)\n- How we maintain context across conversations\n- Knowledge base integration capabilities\n- Brief compliance/security overview\n\nAttendees will be:\n- Jennifer Walsh (VP CS) - our champion\n- David Chen (CTO) - technical decision maker\n- Lisa Rodriguez (Head of Support) - will be primary user\n\nDavid is technical and will ask detailed API questions. Jennifer mentioned they looked at Cohere, so we need to differentiate on quality and integration ease.\n\n**For Sarah (FYI):** They'll need SOC 2 and GDPR documentation during eval. Their legal will likely want to redline our MSA based on Jennifer's comments. Deal size is $200-250K ACV.\n\n**Red flag to watch:** Jennifer mentioned \"budget pressures\" once - confirmed budget exists but may indicate price sensitivity. She also said their current vendor contract ends in March, which creates urgency but also means we're racing the renewal cycle.\n\nLet me know if you need the full transcript or have questions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Resources to Send\n\n**Immediate (Today):**\n1. ✅ Acme Corp case study (customer support use case, similar scale)\n2. ✅ Pricing calculator link\n3. ✅ Zendesk integration one-pager\n\n**Before Demo (by Dec 12):**\n4. SOC 2 Type II certificate\n5. GDPR compliance documentation\n6. API documentation overview\n7. Sample Claude responses for support use cases\n\n**Post-Demo (if interest confirmed):**\n8. ROI calculator with custom inputs\n9. Implementation timeline template\n10. Customer references (2-3 similar companies)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Red Flags \u0026 Risks\n\n⚠️ **Budget Pressure Mentioned:** Jennifer said \"budget pressures\" - may indicate price sensitivity or competing priorities. Need to establish ROI clearly.\n\n⚠️ **Incumbent Renewal Timeline:** Current contract ends March 2024 - tight timeline could work for or against us. If we're not ready to close by February, they might just renew.\n\n⚠️ **CTO Not on First Call:** David (CTO) wasn't on this call - Jennifer will \"loop him in.\" Risk that he's not actually engaged yet. Need him on the demo to qualify properly.\n\n⚠️ **Competitor Awareness:** They're actively talking to Cohere. Need to understand what Cohere is offering and why we're better for this use case.\n\n⚠️ **Unclear Procurement Process:** Jennifer hasn't mentioned legal/procurement yet. Need to map out full decision process and timeline.\n\n**Mitigation Plan:**\n- Nail the ROI story with specific metrics from similar customers\n- Get David engaged ASAP (demo is critical)\n- Understand Cohere's proposal if possible\n- Map out full buying committee in next conversation"])
