Incident investigation MCP application
I'd like to talk about how the uhman interacts with the system, it's very important. I'm thinking CLI so far, as we're talking about engineers so this makes the most sense. But how will they do this? Will it be mainly free text? Or menus? We want to allow engineers to add useful information to the system, but not get sidetracked with useless information, or get agents sidetracked. Similarly, we want to keep the interface simple but convey complex information. We talked about this in the other chat where we talked about how we represent human interactions and the avenues of investigation that ultimately don't prove successful. Let's do some research in the best way for humans to interact with agents, and the best way for there to be an exchange of information between the agent and human. These interactions will prove critical in helping the investigation move in the right direction quickly, so it's important we take the time to think about it. IS there any research on this? Please can you help me as a senior AI interactions researcher, so that we can tailor this interaction to the situation to make it as effective as possible. Thank you!
Synthesized human-AI collaboration research for CLI incident investigation interfaces.
The user is asking about human-agent interaction design for COMPASS, specifically focused on how engineers will interact with the AI agents during incident investigations. They're looking for research-backed approaches to design effective human-AI collaboration interfaces. Let me search for relevant research on this topic.
Key aspects they're interested in:
CLI interface (since it's for engineers)
Balance between free text vs structured menus
Preventing information overload or distractions
Conveying complex information simply
Capturing failed investigation paths as learning artifacts
Research on human-agent interaction patterns
Human-AI interaction research
Command-line interfaces for AI systems
Incident response human-computer interaction
Cognitive load in human-AI collaboration
I'll help you research the best practices for human-agent interaction in your COMPASS system. This is indeed critical - the interface design can make or break the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration during high-pressure incident investigations.

Excellent research gathered! Now let me compile my comprehensive response about human-agent interaction design for COMPASS based on all this research.
Based on my research into human-AI interaction patterns, cognitive load theory, and incident response best practices, I can provide comprehensive guidance for designing COMPASS's human-agent interface. This is a critical design decision that will significantly impact the system's effectiveness.
Key Research Insights for COMPASS Interface Design
The CLI Advantage for Engineers
CLI interfaces are preferred by technical professionals because they offer greater speed, flexibility, and control, allowing complex commands to be executed with a few keystrokes and enabling easy automation through scripting
GUI vs. CLI: What Are the Differences? | Shardeum +2
. With practice, CLI configuration can be far faster compared to GUI, and network administrators have traditionally used CLI for network management
. This aligns perfectly with your target audience of engineers who are already comfortable with command-line tools.
However, GUIs provide visual cues and conventions that allow first-time users to get devices running quickly with basic configuration, particularly helpful when dealing with a broad range of devices
. This suggests a hybrid approach might be optimal.
Mixed-Initiative Systems: The Sweet Spot
Mixed-initiative systems give AI agents responsibility for simpler, repetitive tasks while preserving human control over decision-making, treating AI as a participating agent rather than just a tool
. The agency dimension requires describing how control is decided over the course of collaboration, not just who is generally in charge
AI agents can get incident commanders three steps ahead by bypassing the need to orchestrate data gathering across teams and tools, delivering intelligence briefs that shift cognitive load from "What do we know?" to "What's our best path forward?"
Cognitive Load Management
The more elements on an interface, the greater the cognitive load on users - when cognitive load is high, it consumes most attentional resources, leaving little for processing task-irrelevant information
. In mixed reality environments, operation time increased by 49% under high cognitive load compared to low-load conditions
Eye-tracking research shows that fixation frequency, saccadic rate, and pupil diameter can predict task difficulty during initial interaction phases, suggesting the importance of the first few moments of interface engagement

> What patterns do you see in the database queries?
Primary CLI interface for speed and scripting
Progressive disclosure of information
Visual progress indicators for parallel agent work
Optional GUI dashboard for complex visualizations
"Teach-me" mode showing CLI equivalents of any GUI actions
2. Structured Input with Intelligent Flexibility
Structured data enables automated defenses and scales far beyond manual management, but lacks the rich narrative context that unstructured data provides about the "who, what, where, when, and why" behind an attack
Recommended Approach:
# Core structured commands
"Database timeout causing cascade failure"
"DB connection pool exhaustion on Mondays"
# Natural language overlay for complex reasoning
explain why "The pattern suggests connection pool exhaustion
because we see linear growth
active connections without
corresponding query completion rates"
# Structured templates for common patterns
template connection_leak
### **3. Information Exchange Patterns**
incident response requires perception of hazards
comprehension of their meaning
projection of future status
Design the interface to support
Progressive Information Disclosure
Contextual Understanding
Cache invalidation storm
Previous incident INC
No corresponding application deployments
If hypothesis correct
If hypothesis incorrect
Potential full outage
Implement cache throttling NOW
4. Human-AI Dialogue Management
Unstructured interviews allow for spontaneity and questions to develop during the course of interaction based on responses, with open-ended questions enabling respondents to shift direction and bring in unanticipated information
Adaptive Questioning Strategy:
structured_investigation
hypothesis_validation
# Start structured, become more open as uncertainty increases
pattern_match_confidence
### **5. Preventing Information Overload**
escalating only truly critical issues requiring human intervention
allowing experts to focus on
impact problems instead of false alarms
Smart Filtering Interface
# Intelligent summarization
Database connection spike at
Payment service timeout cascade starting
Unusual retry pattern
### **6. Failed Path Documentation**
Disproven hypotheses are valuable learning artifacts that inform future investigations
Killed blocking query → RESOLVED
All nodes responding to ping
Network alerts were false positive
Memory profiler results
"false-positive-network"
7. Cognitive Handoffs and Context Preservation
AI can provide concise, relevant answers to "Have we seen similar issues before?" within seconds, pulling context from past incidents
# Generate concise briefing for shift changes
### **8. Trust Calibration Through Transparency**
AI agents analyze incidents
actions staying under analyst control
guidance saves valuable time
Application deployment at
due to missing CPU spike
"No corresponding memory pressure"
Adjusting confidence to
Alternative hypothesis
checking connection pool
Implementation Recommendations
Start Simple, Evolve Systematically
: Basic CLI with structured commands
: Add context injection and learning capture
: Introduce natural language overlay
: Visual dashboard for pattern recognition
: Predictive and proactive suggestions
Measurement and Adaptation
Track these metrics to optimize the interface:
Time to first hypothesis
Hypothesis validation rate
False path exploration time
Context switch frequency
Command completion usage
Natural vs. structured input ratio
Critical Success Factors
Human-AI synergy occurs when output outperforms both humans and AI alone, but achieving this requires redesigning the whole process of how they work together, not just dividing subtasks
Preserve engineer agency
while accelerating investigation
Support both novice and expert
Learn from every interaction
when confidence is low
for compliance and learning
This human-first, CLI-centric approach with intelligent augmentation will allow COMPASS to achieve its goal of reducing MTTR by 67-90% while maintaining the trust and control that engineers require in critical incident response scenarios.
so what about me, as a less skilled PO, can I use the tool and simply ask a question like:
, please investigate the issue and help me resolve the incident'
I'd like to be able to get anyone using the tool fairly easily. It's great to have a really detailed engineering setup via the CLI, but I also want to keep it simple. If engineers have to spend a long time learning the tool then they could have just learnt to use the observability tool in the first place! It needs to be simple, and allow engineers to ask questions about the state of their services, thus staying true to the principles of observability. We allow engineers to ask questions or ask for investigations and provide scientific rigour to get the answers. Let's consider all of this, and review the project documents because there's lots there about safe human interactions and promoting a good culture. Let's review all of this information and identify the three best ways to implement all of these ideas. For each of idea, present a structured view of the idea (enough for you to take if forward and flesh it out as intended), provide pros and cons, detailed reasoning for why you've presented the idea and then a rating for complexity to implement the idea, ease of use for engineers (and POs!), cost and sustainability to run the idea, ability to improve culture. Then we can review these and decide if any of them are worth continuing and making into the interface for our system
Synthesized accessibility needs with engineering rigor and cultural principles.
The user is making an excellent point - the system needs to be accessible to less technical users like Product Owners (POs) while still providing the depth that engineers need. They want to maintain simplicity while enabling both natural language queries and sophisticated investigations. Let me review the project documents to understand the cultural and safety aspects better, then propose three implementation approaches.
Let me first check the project documents to understand the existing architecture and principles around human interaction and culture.
I'll review the project documents to understand the cultural and safety aspects, then propose three implementation approaches that balance simplicity with power.

Synthesized cultural principles to architect three balanced interface implementations.
Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project's cultural values around Learning Teams, human decisions as first-class entities, and the need to balance sophisticated engineering capabilities with simplicity and accessibility. The project emphasizes:
Learning Teams methodology over traditional RCA - 114% more improvement opportunities
Human decisions as first-class entities with rich context capture
Psychological safety and blame-free investigation
The importance of both structured and unstructured approaches
Mixed-initiative systems where AI supports but doesn't replace human judgment
Let me now propose three interface implementations that balance:
Simplicity for POs and less experienced engineers
Power for experienced engineers
Cultural promotion through Learning Teams
Scientific rigor in investigations
Accessibility without requiring extensive training
The three approaches should represent different philosophies while meeting all the requirements.
Based on my review of the project documents and research into human-AI interaction patterns, here are three distinct interface approaches that balance simplicity, power, and cultural values:
Option 1: Natural Language First with Progressive Enhancement
"Ask anything, drill deeper when needed"
NaturalLanguageInterface
Primary interaction through conversation, with optional structured commands
Philosophy: Everyone can use it immediately, experts can unlock power features
# Parse intent - is this a question, investigation request, or command?
# "What's happening with product-service?"
INVESTIGATION_REQUEST
# "I've received an SLO alert..."
guided_investigation_mode
# "compass hypothesis add --type database_timeout"
Core Interaction Modes
I've received an SLO alert
I'll investigate the product
Starting scientific analysis
Feature flag deployment at
Feature flag misconfiguration
Checking flag configuration
Database connection exhaustion
Monday pattern matches historical incidents
Analyzing connection pools
What additional context can you provide about recent changes?
Structured Enhancement
Focus on the feature flag issue
Investigate database connections
Check payment service dependencies
Suggest another direction
You can also use commands like
"Payment provider had issues at 14:00"
"Feature flags need gradual rollout"
✅ Zero learning curve - anyone can start immediately
✅ Natural for POs and on-call engineers
✅ Preserves power features without forcing them
✅ Promotes psychological safety (feels like asking a colleague)
✅ Supports Learning Teams through conversational context capture
❌ Natural language ambiguity may require clarification
❌ Power users might find conversation slower initially
❌ Harder to script/automate without structure
❌ Token costs higher for natural language processing
This approach follows research showing that unstructured interviews allow spontaneity and questions to develop during interaction, with open-ended questions enabling respondents to shift direction and bring unanticipated information
. By making conversation the default but allowing structured commands when needed, we accommodate both novice users (POs) and experts without forcing either into an uncomfortable paradigm.
Implementation Complexity:
7/10 (NLP intent classification, context management)
9/10 (natural for everyone, no training required)
6/10 (higher token usage, but can optimize with caching)
9/10 (conversational format promotes open sharing)
Option 2: Visual Investigation Canvas with CLI Companion
"See the investigation unfold, interact how you prefer"
VisualCanvasInterface
Web-based visual investigation map with multiple interaction methods
Philosophy: Make the investigation visible and interactive
<div class="investigation-canvas">
<!-- Visual hypothesis tree showing all paths -->

<!-- Current focus area with details -->
<div class="focus-panel">

What have we learned?
• Feature flags need staged rollout ←
• Monday load patterns differ ←
✅ Visual learners can see the entire investigation
✅ Multiple interaction methods suit different preferences
✅ Reduces cognitive load through spatial organization
✅ Natural collaboration (everyone sees same view)
✅ Built-in documentation of investigation path
❌ Requires browser/screen (not pure terminal)
❌ More complex implementation (frontend + backend)
❌ May overwhelm with too much information
❌ Mobile experience would be limited
The design space of human-AI collaboration includes agency, interaction, and adaptation dimensions, with visual representations helping users understand complex system states
. This approach makes the investigation's state visible while supporting multiple interaction paradigms, crucial for maintaining situation awareness during incidents.
8/10 (requires frontend framework, WebSocket for updates)
7/10 (intuitive but needs visual literacy)
5/10 (efficient structured commands, visual state management)
8/10 (transparency promotes learning culture)
Option 3: Adaptive Conversational Agent with Context-Aware Modes
"The interface that learns and adapts to each user and situation"
Dynamically adjusts interaction style based on user, urgency, and context
Philosophy: One interface that works perfectly for everyone
# Learns preferences over time
# Terse, action-focused
# Detailed, scientific
# Reflective, collaborative
# Educational, verbose

Progressive Revelation
# They know what they're doing
# They need more context
✅ Perfect fit for each user and situation
✅ Reduces cognitive load by adapting to context
✅ Builds user confidence through appropriate guidance
✅ Optimizes for both speed (emergency) and learning
✅ Naturally promotes Learning Teams culture
❌ Complex to implement and test all modes
❌ May be unpredictable (users unsure what to expect)
❌ Requires user profiling and state management
❌ Could be frustrating if mode selection is wrong
Research shows human-AI synergy occurs when systems are redesigned around how humans and AI work together, not just dividing subtasks
. This adaptive approach treats each interaction as unique, optimizing for the specific combination of user expertise, incident severity, and organizational learning needs. The system learns from every interaction, becoming more effective over time.
9/10 (ML for adaptation, complex state management)
8/10 (natural once calibrated, but takes time to learn user)
7/10 (requires profiling, but optimizes token usage over time)
10/10 (explicitly designed for Learning Teams methodology)
Given your goals of accessibility, scientific rigor, and cultural improvement, I recommend
starting with Option 1 (Natural Language First)
Option 3 (Adaptive Agent)
Immediate accessibility
- POs and engineers can use it day one
- Natural language is universal
Progressive enhancement
- Power users aren't limited
- Conversational format naturally promotes psychological safety and learning
- Can add visual canvas and adaptive behaviors as enhancements
Phase 1: Natural language with basic intent recognition
Phase 2: Add structured commands for power users
Phase 3: Introduce visual canvas for complex incidents
Phase 4: Implement adaptive behaviors based on usage patterns
This approach ensures COMPASS remains true to observability principles - allowing engineers to ask questions about their systems while maintaining scientific rigor and promoting a learning culture.
This sounds like a good idea. I like your approach. I really believe me and you can really help many enterprises change their culture with this tool so it's important we make it accessible, friendly and safe for everyone, but still ensure it's open and auditable and clearly captures and records each action taken. The way this information is then presented is also important, but we've covered this in our conversations about post mortems, and we've made an architectureal document for it. Please do the same now for this feature, the interface. Consider everything we've spoken about and referenced, and create a detailed architecture document, which can be referenced from the main architecture document, that Claude Code can use as a complete document to build exactly what we have in mind,
Architected comprehensive interface documentation for enterprise implementation.
The user wants me to create a comprehensive architecture document for the COMPASS human-AI interface system. This needs to be detailed enough for Claude Code to implement, covering all the aspects we've discussed:
Natural language first approach with progressive enhancement
Safety and learning culture considerations from Learning Teams methodology
Audit trail and transparency requirements
Multiple interaction modes (conversational, structured, expert)
Integration with the existing COMPASS architecture
Clear recording of human decisions as first-class entities
Adaptive behaviors over time
I should structure this as a formal architecture document that:
References the existing COMPASS architecture
Provides clear implementation guidance
Includes code examples and data models
Addresses all non-functional requirements (safety, auditability, culture)
Can serve as a standalone reference for implementation
Let me create a comprehensive document that captures everything we've discussed.
COMPASS Human-AI Interface Architecture
This document defines the architecture for COMPASS's human-AI interface system, designed to democratize incident investigation while promoting a learning culture. The interface implements a "Natural Language First" approach with progressive enhancement, enabling both Product Owners and Senior Engineers to effectively investigate incidents without extensive training. Every interaction is auditable, every decision is captured with context, and the system actively promotes psychological safety through Learning Teams methodology.
The interface serves as the primary interaction layer between human operators and COMPASS's multi-agent investigation system, translating natural language queries into scientific investigations while preserving human agency and capturing organizational learning.

Materials for user onboarding and training
# COMPASS Quick Start
## For Everyone (No Training Required)
Just type what you need:
- "What's happening with the database?"
- "Show me recent incidents for user-api"
COMPASS will guide you through the investigation.
Use commands for more control:
- `hypothesis add "Cache invalidation issue"`
- `focus database --confidence high`
- `explain reasoning --verbose`
## Remember: It's About Learning, Not Blame
We ask "What happened?" not "Who did it?"
We ask "What made sense?" not "Why did you fail?"

This architecture provides a comprehensive interface system that makes COMPASS accessible to everyone while preserving power for experts. By prioritizing natural language interaction, psychological safety, and complete auditability, we create a system that not only reduces MTTR but fundamentally improves organizational culture.
The interface serves as more than just a communication layer - it's an active participant in building a learning organization, where every incident becomes an opportunity for system improvement rather than blame assignment.
Through progressive enhancement and adaptive complexity, we ensure that a Product Owner can get help immediately while a Senior Engineer can dive deep into scientific investigation. Most importantly, every interaction is captured, reasoned about, and learned from, building an ever-improving knowledge base that makes future investigations faster and more effective.
This is how we change enterprise culture: one conversation at a time, one investigation at a time, one learning at a time.
that's great but I don't see a document that's been created? Can I have it please?
Resolved to materialize the architecture document as file.
The user is asking for the document to be created as an actual file. I should create the comprehensive architecture document we just discussed as a markdown file that can be saved and used.
I'll create the interface architecture document as a proper file for you.

self.__next_f.push([1,"Create a react app based on the following spec: PyLingo is an interactive web-based Python learning platform that teaches programming fundamentals through a gamified, hands-on coding experience. The application features a structured curriculum of 15 progressive levels, covering essential Python concepts from basic Hello World programs to advanced topics like functions, loops, and data structures. Each level presents users with a clear task, educational context, and a practical coding exercise that must be completed using the integrated dark-themed code editor that mimics professional development environments.\nThe platform provides comprehensive learning support through immediate feedback validation, detailed explanations, and contextual hints. When users submit code, the system compares their input against expected outputs and provides instant correctness assessment. Incorrect submissions display the expected solution alongside educational explanations to reinforce learning, while optional hints can be toggled on demand for additional guidance. Users can also reset their progress on any level to practice until mastery is achieved.\nStrong gamification elements drive user engagement through streak tracking (consecutive correct answers), progress visualization, and completion badges. The interface includes a header progress bar, level completion indicators, and an intuitive level selector that allows flexible navigation between unlocked levels with color-coded completion status. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the responsive design features a clean blue and white color scheme with professional layout that balances educational functionality with visual appeal across different devices."])

It would meet the design standards of Airbnb, Facebook, etc. Have a debug panel that shows the raw response from the last API call. Functionality: Using the Claude API and the Gmail MCP, fetch the users 50 most recent conversations from their inbox when they load the page. Filter out anything that looks like it doesn’t need a reply (newsletters, spam, the user is already the last one to reply on the thread etc) and then display the set of emails that potentially need replies. The emails should be displayed in an inbox style format where you see the sender and subject line and the user can click in to view the actual contents. Make sure to save the threadId for each email, since you will need it later. When a user clicks into a email, have a text area called Brief Reply Instructions where they can write some brief notes on what the reply should be. There should be a button Draft Reply that they can click. When they click Draft Reply make a call to the Claude API to draft an email reply based on the instructions the user input. Display the draft to the user and let them make edits. The user can edit the reply and then there is a Save button for the user to save the email draft. If the users clicks Save then make a call to the Claude API and Gmail MCP to save the email as a draft. Make sure to pass threadId when you make the call to save the draft so the reply is within the original email thread. Once they have saved a draft, show a widget at the bottom that shows a count of the total number of drafts a user has saved along with a link Send Drafts that links to https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#drafts"])

Follow-up Email to Prospect\n\n**Subject:** Great connecting today - next steps for [Company Name]\n\n**Draft:**\n\nHi Jennifer,\n\nThank you for taking the time to walk me through [Company]'s AI strategy and current challenges with your customer support automation. I appreciated your candor about the limitations you're experiencing with your current provider.\n\nBased on our conversation, here's what I understood as your key priorities:\n\n- **Response quality:** You need more accurate, contextual responses that reduce escalations to human agents (currently at 35%)\n- **Integration requirements:** Must work seamlessly with Zendesk and your internal knowledge base\n- **Compliance:** GDPR and SOC 2 are non-negotiable given your EU customer base\n- **Timeline:** Ideally pilot by Q1 2024 to support your seasonal volume spike\n\nI'm excited about how Claude could help. Our customers in similar use cases typically see 60-70% reduction in escalation rates within the first month.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. I'll send over the Acme Corp case study you requested (similar industry, similar scale)\n2. Our solutions engineer will prepare a custom demo for your team on Dec 15th\n3. I'll get you connected with our security team to review compliance documentation\n\nDoes the Dec 15th demo work for you? I'd like to include your Head of Support and CTO if possible.\n\nLooking forward to exploring this further.\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Action Items\n\n**My Actions:**\n- [ ] Send Acme Corp case study - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule demo for Dec 15th, confirm attendees - **Due: By EOD Wednesday**\n- [ ] Loop in solutions engineering (cc: Mike) - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Request security documentation packet from compliance team - **Due: Tomorrow**\n- [ ] Send pricing calculator link - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule follow-up call for post-demo (week of Dec 18) - **Due: By Friday**\n\n**Customer Actions:**\n- Confirm Dec 15th demo time and attendees - **Expected: This week**\n- Review case study and pricing - **Expected: Before demo**\n- Provide API documentation for Zendesk integration - **Expected: By Dec 10**\n\n**Internal Actions:**\n- **Mike (Solutions Engineer):** Prepare custom demo focusing on Zendesk integration - **Due: Dec 12**\n- **Sarah (Legal):** Review their MSA redlines if deal progresses - **FYI for now**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Salesforce Update\n\n**Opportunity Details:**\n- **Company:** Acme Technologies, Inc.\n- **Size:** 500 employees, $50M ARR SaaS company\n- **Current spend on AI:** ~$150K/year (competitor solution)\n- **Potential ACV:** $200-250K (based on volume discussed)\n- **Decision timeline:** Pilot Q1 2024, full rollout Q2 2024\n- **Budget:** Confirmed allocated, part of 2024 ops budget\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- High escalation rate (35%) with current AI support tool\n- Poor context retention across conversations\n- Compliance concerns with current vendor's data handling\n- Integration limitations with existing tech stack\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Must integrate with Zendesk (primary support platform)\n- Connect to internal knowledge base (Confluence)\n- GDPR compliant (EU customers)\n- SOC 2 Type II required\n- API access for custom workflows\n\n**Stakeholders:**\n- **Jennifer Walsh** (VP Customer Success) - Champion, main contact\n- **David Chen** (CTO) - Technical buyer, final sign-off required\n- **Lisa Rodriguez** (Head of Support) - End user, needs to see demo\n- **Unknown** - Procurement/Legal (will surface during contract phase)\n\n**Next Steps \u0026 Timeline:**\n- Dec 15: Custom demo for Jennifer, David, and Lisa\n- Dec 18-22: Follow-up call to address questions\n- Jan 2024: Pilot program (1-2 support agents)\n- Feb 2024: Internal review and decision\n- Mar 2024: Rollout to full team (15 support agents)\n\n**Probability:** 60% - Strong interest, budget confirmed, clear pain, but need to win technical evaluation vs. current provider and one other competitor mentioned (Cohere)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Internal Team Note\n\n**To:** Mike (Solutions Engineering), Sarah (Legal - FYI)\n\n**Subject:** New opp needs demo support - Acme Technologies\n\nTeam,\n\nJust got off a great call with Acme Technologies (500 person SaaS company). They're frustrated with their current AI support solution and actively evaluating alternatives.\n\n**Ask for Mike:** Can you prepare a custom demo for Dec 15th? Key things to showcase:\n- Zendesk integration (this is critical)\n- How we maintain context across conversations\n- Knowledge base integration capabilities\n- Brief compliance/security overview\n\nAttendees will be:\n- Jennifer Walsh (VP CS) - our champion\n- David Chen (CTO) - technical decision maker\n- Lisa Rodriguez (Head of Support) - will be primary user\n\nDavid is technical and will ask detailed API questions. Jennifer mentioned they looked at Cohere, so we need to differentiate on quality and integration ease.\n\n**For Sarah (FYI):** They'll need SOC 2 and GDPR documentation during eval. Their legal will likely want to redline our MSA based on Jennifer's comments. Deal size is $200-250K ACV.\n\n**Red flag to watch:** Jennifer mentioned \"budget pressures\" once - confirmed budget exists but may indicate price sensitivity. She also said their current vendor contract ends in March, which creates urgency but also means we're racing the renewal cycle.\n\nLet me know if you need the full transcript or have questions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Resources to Send\n\n**Immediate (Today):**\n1. ✅ Acme Corp case study (customer support use case, similar scale)\n2. ✅ Pricing calculator link\n3. ✅ Zendesk integration one-pager\n\n**Before Demo (by Dec 12):**\n4. SOC 2 Type II certificate\n5. GDPR compliance documentation\n6. API documentation overview\n7. Sample Claude responses for support use cases\n\n**Post-Demo (if interest confirmed):**\n8. ROI calculator with custom inputs\n9. Implementation timeline template\n10. Customer references (2-3 similar companies)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Red Flags \u0026 Risks\n\n⚠️ **Budget Pressure Mentioned:** Jennifer said \"budget pressures\" - may indicate price sensitivity or competing priorities. Need to establish ROI clearly.\n\n⚠️ **Incumbent Renewal Timeline:** Current contract ends March 2024 - tight timeline could work for or against us. If we're not ready to close by February, they might just renew.\n\n⚠️ **CTO Not on First Call:** David (CTO) wasn't on this call - Jennifer will \"loop him in.\" Risk that he's not actually engaged yet. Need him on the demo to qualify properly.\n\n⚠️ **Competitor Awareness:** They're actively talking to Cohere. Need to understand what Cohere is offering and why we're better for this use case.\n\n⚠️ **Unclear Procurement Process:** Jennifer hasn't mentioned legal/procurement yet. Need to map out full decision process and timeline.\n\n**Mitigation Plan:**\n- Nail the ROI story with specific metrics from similar customers\n- Get David engaged ASAP (demo is critical)\n- Understand Cohere's proposal if possible\n- Map out full buying committee in next conversation"])
