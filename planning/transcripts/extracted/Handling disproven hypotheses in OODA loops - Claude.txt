Incident investigation MCP application
I'm thinking about the OODA loops and specifically the loops part. What happen when we disprove a hypothesis? This should be fed back in. But some interactions are human. What happens when we disprove a human led hypothesis? How do we feed this information back to the system and the human? We will need to start the investigation again but we have be evidence! As part of our scientific process we talked about in another chat, we should invoice this evidence and start again. How do we handle this? I'm interested in making sure we use disproven hypotheses in our continued investigation, making these available to the agents still investigating, how we differentiate human investigations, actions and disproven hypotheses in our reporting (for the post mortem), and how we handle explaining this information to the Human. We need a way of representing the investigation, the avenues we've taken etc, in a way that helps the human understand and digest what's happened, learn from the information, and continue the investigation better for it. I'm still thinking of a terminal interface. How can we achieve this?
Synthesized feedback loops, evidence preservation, and human-AI investigation differentiation strategies.
This is a really thoughtful question about the OODA loop in COMPASS, specifically about handling disproven hypotheses and the feedback mechanisms. Let me break down what Ivan is asking about:
Feedback loops for disproven hypotheses
- When a hypothesis is disproven (either by AI agents or by human investigation), that evidence needs to feed back into the system
Human vs AI differentiation
- Need to distinguish between human-led investigations and AI-led ones
Evidence preservation
- Disproven hypotheses contain valuable evidence that should inform continued investigation
- How do agents currently investigating benefit from disproven hypothesis evidence?
Post-mortem representation
- How to show this in the incident report
- How to present this complex information in a terminal interface that helps the human understand the investigation flow
This is really about the scientific method in action - disproven hypotheses are actually valuable data points that constrain the solution space. Let me search the project knowledge to see what we've already discussed about this.
Excellent question! This gets at the heart of how COMPASS learns and evolves during an investigation. Let me search our project knowledge for what we've discussed about the scientific method and feedback loops.

Synthesized investigation frameworks and terminal UI representation strategies.
Excellent! I found some great material about:
Learning teams vs RCA - which emphasizes learning from disproven paths
The importance of representing the investigation journey
State management and investigation flow
Now let me search for more about terminal UI and investigation representation specifically.
Perfect! This is a rich question that touches on several critical aspects of COMPASS. Let me break down a comprehensive approach to handling disproven hypotheses and representing the investigation journey.
You've identified something crucial:
disproven hypotheses are not failures—they're valuable evidence that constrains the solution space
. This aligns perfectly with the "Learning Teams" approach from your research, which shows that focusing on the investigation
(not just the outcome) generates 57% more system-focused improvements than traditional RCA.

Key Benefits of This Approach
: Following the research showing Learning Teams generate 57% more system-focused improvements, we document
we investigated, not just the outcome
: Agents get explicit constraints from disproven hypotheses, preventing wasted effort on already-ruled-out paths
Human Decisions Are First-Class
: Clear differentiation in UI, timeline, and post-mortem between AI and human investigations
: Rich, scannable terminal UI that shows investigation state at a glance
: Disproven hypotheses are treated as valuable data, not failures
: Track costs of both successful and unsuccessful investigation paths
Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect? For example:
The terminal UI rendering with actual Rich library code?
How to handle conflicting evidence between disproven hypotheses?
Strategies for presenting this to humans during active investigation vs in post-mortem?
Let's talk more about your third point
Examined implementation obstacles in human decision documentation systems.
The user wants to dive deeper into "Human Decisions Are First-Class" - making sure that human decisions, actions, and disproven hypotheses are clearly differentiated and properly represented throughout the system.
This is a critical design choice that reflects the "human-in-the-loop" philosophy of COMPASS. Let me think about the key aspects:
Human expertise is qualitatively different from AI pattern matching
Human decisions often involve context/intuition that AI doesn't have
Post-mortems need to show when humans overrode AI or chose unexpected paths
Learning culture means we need to understand WHY humans made decisions
Future incidents benefit from understanding human reasoning patterns
Visual distinction in UI (colors, icons, emphasis)
Metadata tracking (who, when, why, context)
Authority levels (human decisions can override AI)
Reasoning capture (why did the human choose this path?)
Outcome tracking (was the human right? wrong? partially right?)
Implementation challenges
Capturing human reasoning without being intrusive
Making it easy for humans to document their thinking
Balancing speed (humans are busy during incidents) with documentation
Showing respect for human expertise while also learning from mistakes
Not creating blame culture
Let me develop this comprehensively.
Excellent! Let's dive deep into
Human Decisions as First-Class Citizens
. This is absolutely critical because COMPASS is fundamentally about
human-AI collaboration
, not AI replacement.
Why Human Decisions Deserve Special Treatment
The research on Learning Teams shows something crucial:
how decisions are made matters as much as what decisions are made
. When we track human reasoning, we:
- Human intuition often picks up patterns AI misses
- Future responders can see "why did Sarah choose that path?"
- Humans see their decisions are valued, not just AI suggestions
- Focus on process, not individual failure
- Human decisions that disprove AI suggestions are training data

Key Differentiators in Practice
: Regular text, blue/cyan, 🤖 icon
: Bold text, yellow/red, 👤 icon
: Highlighted with ⚠️ and explanation
Human decisions capture:
Respect for Expertise
Never call human decisions "wrong" - call them "different paths"
Document tacit knowledge explicitly
Show when human intuition was right
Learn from human overrides
Focus on process, not blame
Document "why" not just "what"
Treat disagreements as learning opportunities
Build knowledge base from human reasoning
Would you like me to develop:
How to handle cases where human was wrong (without blame)?
Machine learning from human decisions to improve AI suggestions?
Real-time collaboration features (multiple humans, chat integration)?
I like all of these suggestions! Let's focus on the first one though, How to handle cases where human was wrong (without blame)
Synthesized blame-free frameworks using systems thinking and scientific methodology.
This is a really important question because it gets at the heart of building a learning culture vs. a blame culture. The research Ivan has on Learning Teams shows that shifting focus from "who was wrong" to "why did the system allow this to happen" generates much better outcomes.
Never call it "wrong" - use neutral language like "unexpected outcome" or "hypothesis disproven"
Focus on SYSTEM factors that led to the decision, not individual failure
Capture what information was missing or misleading
Use it as a learning opportunity for both humans AND AI
Recognize that "being wrong" in incident investigation is actually valuable data - it's part of the scientific method
The Learning Teams research about removing blame
The scientific method approach - disproved hypotheses are successes, not failures
The "Problem with Root Cause Analysis" paper about how RCA creates blame culture
Systems thinking - look at what system factors contributed
Let me design a comprehensive approach that treats human "mistakes" as valuable system learning opportunities.
Excellent choice! This is
for building a learning culture. The research on Learning Teams shows that when we shift from "who was wrong" to "what system factors contributed," we get 57% more actionable improvements.
Core Philosophy: There Are No "Wrong" Decisions, Only Unexpected Outcomes
When a human's hypothesis is disproven or their decision doesn't lead to resolution, we treat it as
valuable data about system complexity

Key Principles Summary
"Unexpected outcome" not "wrong decision"
"Learning value" not "wasted effort"
Always explain WHY the decision was reasonable given the context
Show what information they had
Acknowledge time pressure, ambiguity, etc.
What information was missing?
What metrics were misleading?
What documentation gaps existed?
Every disproven hypothesis narrows the solution space
Discovering confusable cases is valuable
Identifying observability gaps prevents future incidents
Framed as learning opportunity
Human controls their narrative
Share knowledge, not blame
Build collective expertise
How to handle repeated "unexpected outcomes" by the same person (coaching without blame)?
Metrics for measuring learning culture vs. blame culture?
Integration with existing incident review processes (Confluence templates, Jira tickets, etc.)?
Let's summarise this chat in an architectural document that can be used to contribute to the overall design of system. This document will be read by Claude and my hope is that in reading this document, Claude will have everything it needs to include everything we've discussed in its final architecture document. If you're unsure on anything then please check with me.
Architected comprehensive system document synthesizing OODA loops and investigation frameworks.
The user wants me to create a comprehensive architectural document that summarizes everything we discussed in this chat about:
OODA loops and the "loops" part - handling disproven hypotheses
Feeding disproven evidence back into the system
Differentiating human vs AI investigations
Terminal interface representation
Human decisions as first-class citizens
Handling cases where humans were "wrong" (without blame)
This document should be:
Comprehensive enough that Claude (in the future) can use it to implement these features
Well-structured and clear
Connected to the existing COMPASS architecture
Focused on the key innovations we discussed
Let me structure this logically:
Core Problem & Solution
Architecture Components
Learning & Feedback Systems
Implementation Guidelines
I should check if there's anything I'm unsure about before writing.
I'll create a comprehensive architectural document capturing everything we discussed. Let me make sure I understand the scope correctly:
This document should cover:
✅ OODA loop feedback mechanisms (disproven hypotheses feeding back into investigation)
✅ Disproven evidence preservation and reuse by active agents
✅ Human vs AI investigation differentiation (in data model, UI, and post-mortem)
✅ Terminal interface design for investigation visualization
✅ Human decision tracking as first-class entities
✅ Blameless retrospective system for unexpected outcomes
Questions before I write:
Should this document be standalone, or should it reference the existing architecture documents (compass_architecture.txt) and assume those as foundation?
Full code examples (like we discussed), OR
Architectural patterns with key code snippets, OR
High-level design that Claude Code can implement details of?
Should I explicitly call out:
Where this plugs into existing OODA loop (from compass_architecture.txt)?
Integration with existing Investigation State Machine?
Integration with MCP Gateway and agents?
Should I create this as:
A new Part 6 that extends the existing 5-part architecture guide, OR
A standalone "Investigation Learning & Human Collaboration Module" document, OR
An addendum/enhancement document?
Let me know your preferences and I'll create exactly what you need!
Definitely reference the existing architecture. But also suggest changes if needed. It's a foundation you can build on.
Let's go with the middle option, architectural patterns. This will be referenced in the main architecture document. Ultimately, it's a guide for Claude to build the right thing. Go into as much detail as you need to make that happen.
Explicitly call out all integration points. Having each component's contracts clearly defined is an important aspect of an extensible architecture.
This document will become a reference document in the main architecture document. Consider it the main architecture artefact got this aspect of the system.
I hope that answers your questions. Please ask me if you have any more uncertainty
Architected comprehensive specification integrating patterns, contracts, and implementation guidance.
Perfect! The user wants:
Reference existing architecture, suggest changes where needed
Architectural patterns with enough detail for Claude Code to implement
Explicit integration points and contracts
This becomes THE reference document for the investigation learning & human collaboration aspects
So I need to create a comprehensive architectural document that:
References compass_architecture.txt
Defines clear contracts/interfaces
Shows architectural patterns with key code snippets
Calls out integration points explicitly
Can be used by Claude Code to implement the system
Covers all our discussion: OODA feedback, disproven hypotheses, human decisions as first-class, terminal UI, blameless retrospectives
Let me structure this as a comprehensive architectural specification document.
Perfect! I have everything I need. Let me create a comprehensive architectural document.

Please double-check responses.
COMPASS: Investigation Learning & Human Collaboration Architecture
Architectural Specification
Define how COMPASS learns from investigations, preserves disproven hypotheses, treats human decisions as first-class entities, and implements blameless retrospectives
This document specifies the
Investigation Learning & Human Collaboration
subsystem of COMPASS. While the core OODA loop architecture (defined in
) handles the mechanical flow of Observe → Orient → Decide → Act, this subsystem addresses the critical
that makes COMPASS improve over time.
Traditional incident investigation systems treat disproven hypotheses as failures and discard them. Human decisions are not differentiated from AI suggestions. When humans make unexpected choices, there's no structured way to learn from them without blame.
Disproven hypotheses become learning artifacts
that constrain future investigations
Human decisions are first-class entities
with rich context, reasoning capture, and retrospective analysis
Terminal interface visualizes investigation journey
including dead ends and pivot points
Blameless retrospectives focus on system factors
, not individual performance
Learning culture metrics
replace blame culture metrics
This subsystem integrates with the existing OODA loop, Investigation State Machine, and Agent Orchestrator to create a
continuously learning incident response system
Investigation Chronicle: The Complete Story
Terminal UI: Investigation Visualization
Post-Mortem Generation
1. Core Concepts & Terminology
From Learning Teams Research:
Learning Teams approach generates 57% more system-focused improvements than traditional Root Cause Analysis
(how we investigated) not just
Document investigation journey including dead ends
Avoid blame by focusing on system factors
COMPASS Implementation:
: A disproven hypothesis is valuable data that narrows the solution space
: Humans make all critical decisions; AI accelerates data gathering
: Every investigation improves future investigations
: No blame for unexpected outcomes; focus on system improvements
: Investigation journey is transparent and traceable
# Core investigation outcome types
"""Neutral language for outcomes - no 'wrong' or 'failed'"""
# System factors that influence decisions (not human factors)
"""System-level factors that influenced investigation decisions"""
# Decision authority model
# Future: AI suggests, human can override
# Future: AI can proceed
2. Integration with Existing Architecture
2.1 Reference to Existing Components
This subsystem integrates with components defined in
After "ACT" phase, before loop restart
Learning Feedback Loop captures disproven hypotheses
OODA Controller now maintains Investigation Chronicle
Part 3: Investigation State Machine
All state transitions trigger Chronicle updates
Human Decision Points are new state types
State Machine now tracks human vs AI actions separately
Part 4: Agent Orchestrator
Orchestrator receives constraint context from disproven hypotheses
Agents see what's been ruled out before generating hypotheses
Part 5: Post-Mortem Generation
Replaces simple post-mortem with learning-focused version
Blameless Retrospective Generator
Post-mortems include investigation journey section

Change 3: Investigation State Machine Enhancement
(from compass_architecture.txt Part 3):
InvestigationStateMachine
"""Move from Orient to Decide (human selection)"""
# NEW: Chronicle reference
Move from Orient to Decide (human selection)
NEW: Creates HumanDecisionPoint to capture decision context
InvalidStateTransition

3. Investigation Chronicle: The Complete Story
is the authoritative record of everything that happened during an investigation. It's not just a log - it's a structured, queryable artifact that supports:
Real-time investigation state visualization
Learning from disproven hypotheses
Blameless retrospectives
Post-mortem generation
Pattern recognition across incidents
Chronicle is append-only (events never deleted) but can be annotated (retrospectives add context).
A hypothesis that has been ruled out through evidence
Key insight: This is NOT a failure - it's valuable data that
narrows the solution space and teaches us about the system
# For human-led investigations
is_human_investigation
"""Check if this was investigated by a human"""
A single event in the investigation timeline
Used for visualization and retrospective analysis
# "observation", "hypothesis_generated", "hypothesis_disproven",
# "human_decision", "phase_transition", "data_request"
# "database_agent", "human:alice@company.com", "orchestrator"
# "what", "where", "why"
"""Check if this event was triggered by a human"""
"""Check if this event represents a disproven hypothesis"""
This is the authoritative record for:
- Real-time investigation state
- Learning from disproven hypotheses
- Blameless retrospectives
- Post-mortem generation
# "investigating", "resolved", "escalated"
# Hypotheses tracking
# Constraints learned from disproofs
# Human-led investigations
# For retrospective analysis
'HumanDecisionRetrospective'
Add a disproven hypothesis and update constraints
This is a key method - it preserves the learning and makes it
available to all agents still investigating
# Remove from active if present

3.3 Integration Contract
Chronicle Provider Interface:
Interface for components that need access to investigation chronicle
"""Get chronicle for an incident"""
"""Persist chronicle updates"""
Manages investigation chronicles
Provides thread-safe access and persistence
"""Create new investigation chronicle"""
"""Get existing chronicle"""
- Receives chronicle in constructor, updates after each loop
- Receives chronicle in constructor, updates on state transitions
- Receives chronicle as parameter to
generate_hypotheses()
- Receive chronicle to render current state
RetrospectiveAnalyzer
- Receives chronicle to analyze decisions
- Receives chronicle to generate comprehensive post-mortem
4. Disproven Hypothesis Management
When a hypothesis is disproven (either by AI or human), it's not discarded. Instead, it becomes a
Constrains future hypotheses
- Agents won't regenerate similar ideas
Narrows solution space
- We know what it's NOT
Teaches pattern recognition
- Similar symptoms might not mean what we thought
Identifies system gaps
- What observability/docs would have helped?
4.2 Agent Knowledge Context Builder
Provide agents with context from disproven hypotheses so they generate better hypotheses.
Builds investigation context for agents
This context is prepended to agent prompts to prevent
regenerating disproven hypotheses
"WHAT WE'VE RULED OUT:\n"
"AI-Investigated Paths (ruled out):\n"
"Human-Investigated Paths (ruled out):\n"
f"     Human insight:
# Still investigating
CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING:
Generate new hypotheses that:
1. Explain the observed symptoms
2. DON'T repeat any of the disproven paths above
5. Are distinct from hypotheses currently being investigated
build_disproof_context
Build context for attempting to disprove a hypothesis
Includes similar hypotheses that were disproven
HYPOTHESIS TESTING CONTEXT
# Find similar disproven hypotheses
_find_similar_disproven
"SIMILAR HYPOTHESES THAT WERE RULED OUT:\n"
f"    How it was disproven:
"Learn from these past attempts when designing your disproof queries.\n\n"
Find disproven hypotheses similar to current one
Uses simple keyword matching; could be enhanced with embeddings
4.3 Lessons Learned Extraction
Automatically extract what a disproven hypothesis teaches us.
LessonsLearnedExtractor
Extracts structured lessons from disproven hypotheses
Use LLM to extract what this disproof teaches us
A hypothesis was disproven during incident investigation:
CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE:
Extract 3-5 clear lessons about what this teaches us about the system
and the problem space. Format as constraints that prevent similar
wrong hypotheses in the future.
Examples of good lessons:
- "Connection pool has available capacity, so issue is not resource exhaustion"
- "Issue affects only US-EAST region, so not a global configuration problem"
Return as JSON array of strings:
extract_lessons_from_human_investigation
Extract lessons from human-led investigation
Prioritizes human-provided lessons but supplements with automatic extraction
# Human explicitly provided lessons
# Extract from tacit knowledge
# Extract from conclusion
4.4 Integration Contract
"""Interface for components that generate hypotheses"""
# Must include chronicle
"""Generate hypotheses constrained by disproven paths"""
"""Interface for components that test hypotheses"""
"""Test hypothesis with awareness of past attempts"""
(Database, Network, etc.) implements
provides chronicle to all agents
is injected into all agents that need context
5. Human Decisions as First-Class Entities
Human decisions are not just data points - they are
Rich context (what information was available)
Explicit reasoning (why the human chose this path)
Agreement tracking (did human agree with AI?)
Retrospective analysis (what happened after)
Learning extraction (what should we learn?)
Every human decision is an opportunity to learn, whether it leads to resolution or requires pivoting.
5.2 Human Decision Point Data Model
# Human has their own theory
A point where human judgment was required
Captures the full context, reasoning, and outcome
This is a RICH entity that preserves the complete decision context
for learning and retrospective analysis
# Investigation state at time of decision
# WHY they chose it (CRITICAL!)
# Outcome tracking (filled in later during retrospective)
"""Check if human overrode AI recommendation"""
"""Get human-readable summary of decision"""
Different from AI investigation - captures human process and expertise
'ExternalDataResponse'
5.3 Human Decision Capture Interface
Terminal UI for capturing rich human decision context.
Terminal interface that makes human decisions clear and captures reasoning
- Make context visible
- Capture reasoning, not just choice
- Show AI recommendation clearly
- No pressure, just structured thinking
Returns: Updated decision point with human's choice and reasoning
# Show options and get choice
# Show recent disproven paths (last 3)
"""Capture a hypothesis from human"""

- UI shows final summary with all paths explored
7. Blameless Retrospective System
When a human's decision leads to an unexpected outcome (hypothesis disproven, required pivot), we conduct a
blameless retrospective
Validates the human's reasoning
- Shows why it was reasonable given context
Identifies system factors
- What information was missing/misleading?
- What should the system improve?
- Focus on "what can we learn" not "who was wrong"
There are no "wrong" decisions, only unexpected outcomes that teach us about system complexity.
Stored for future pattern recognition
# How to differentiate

Appendix A: Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: Human Overrides AI, Correctly
AI recommends "Database connection pool exhaustion" but human chooses "Network latency spike to database region"
Chronicle records decision with
Human provides reasoning: "I've seen this pattern before - latency correlates with time of day"
Investigation proceeds with human's hypothesis
Hypothesis is confirmed
Retrospective notes: "Human experience recognized time-of-day pattern that AI missed"
AI improves to check time-of-day correlation for database issues
Scenario 2: Human Overrides AI, Incorrectly
AI recommends "Cache invalidation issue" but human chooses "Database index problem"
Human provides reasoning: "Recent schema change makes this likely"
Investigation proceeds, hypothesis disproven
Retrospective analysis shows:
Recent schema change was related
Cache metrics were not prominently displayed
Cache hit rate dropped 80%
Post-mortem says "Symptoms were misleading; cache metrics should be more visible"
Add cache metrics to default dashboard
AI learns to surface cache data earlier
Documentation updated with cache troubleshooting
Scenario 3: Multiple Dead Ends Lead to Learning
Investigation explores 4 hypotheses before finding root cause
AI suggests 3 hypotheses, all disproven
Human suggests 4th hypothesis based on intuition, also disproven
Final hypothesis (from combining learnings) is correct
Post-mortem shows complete journey:
Each dead end narrowed solution space
Human intuition added valuable context
Combination of AI speed + human insight succeeded
Clear timeline of all paths
Cost of each exploration
Value gained from each disproof
How final hypothesis emerged from learnings
Appendix B: Future Enhancements

This architecture specification defines how COMPASS learns from every investigation, treats human decisions as first-class entities, and implements blameless retrospectives. Key principles:
Disproven hypotheses are learning artifacts
Human decisions receive rich context capture
and retrospective analysis
Terminal UI visualizes complete investigation journey
, enabling continuous improvement
Learning system builds pattern database
from every investigation
By implementing this subsystem, COMPASS becomes not just an incident investigation tool, but a
continuously learning system
that improves with every incident while maintaining psychological safety and human authority.

self.__next_f.push([1,"Create a react app based on the following spec: PyLingo is an interactive web-based Python learning platform that teaches programming fundamentals through a gamified, hands-on coding experience. The application features a structured curriculum of 15 progressive levels, covering essential Python concepts from basic Hello World programs to advanced topics like functions, loops, and data structures. Each level presents users with a clear task, educational context, and a practical coding exercise that must be completed using the integrated dark-themed code editor that mimics professional development environments.\nThe platform provides comprehensive learning support through immediate feedback validation, detailed explanations, and contextual hints. When users submit code, the system compares their input against expected outputs and provides instant correctness assessment. Incorrect submissions display the expected solution alongside educational explanations to reinforce learning, while optional hints can be toggled on demand for additional guidance. Users can also reset their progress on any level to practice until mastery is achieved.\nStrong gamification elements drive user engagement through streak tracking (consecutive correct answers), progress visualization, and completion badges. The interface includes a header progress bar, level completion indicators, and an intuitive level selector that allows flexible navigation between unlocked levels with color-coded completion status. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the responsive design features a clean blue and white color scheme with professional layout that balances educational functionality with visual appeal across different devices."])

self.__next_f.push([1,"I want to create a react artifact called Email Reply Drafter. UX: Beautiful professionally designed with white background, blue buttons. It would meet the design standards of Airbnb, Facebook, etc. Have a debug panel that shows the raw response from the last API call. Functionality: Using the Claude API and the Gmail MCP, fetch the users 50 most recent conversations from their inbox when they load the page. Filter out anything that looks like it doesn’t need a reply (newsletters, spam, the user is already the last one to reply on the thread etc) and then display the set of emails that potentially need replies. The emails should be displayed in an inbox style format where you see the sender and subject line and the user can click in to view the actual contents. Make sure to save the threadId for each email, since you will need it later. When a user clicks into a email, have a text area called Brief Reply Instructions where they can write some brief notes on what the reply should be. There should be a button Draft Reply that they can click. When they click Draft Reply make a call to the Claude API to draft an email reply based on the instructions the user input. Display the draft to the user and let them make edits. The user can edit the reply and then there is a Save button for the user to save the email draft. If the users clicks Save then make a call to the Claude API and Gmail MCP to save the email as a draft.

Follow-up Email to Prospect\n\n**Subject:** Great connecting today - next steps for [Company Name]\n\n**Draft:**\n\nHi Jennifer,\n\nThank you for taking the time to walk me through [Company]'s AI strategy and current challenges with your customer support automation. I appreciated your candor about the limitations you're experiencing with your current provider.\n\nBased on our conversation, here's what I understood as your key priorities:\n\n- **Response quality:** You need more accurate, contextual responses that reduce escalations to human agents (currently at 35%)\n- **Integration requirements:** Must work seamlessly with Zendesk and your internal knowledge base\n- **Compliance:** GDPR and SOC 2 are non-negotiable given your EU customer base\n- **Timeline:** Ideally pilot by Q1 2024 to support your seasonal volume spike\n\nI'm excited about how Claude could help. Our customers in similar use cases typically see 60-70% reduction in escalation rates within the first month.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. I'll send over the Acme Corp case study you requested (similar industry, similar scale)\n2. Our solutions engineer will prepare a custom demo for your team on Dec 15th\n3. I'll get you connected with our security team to review compliance documentation\n\nDoes the Dec 15th demo work for you? I'd like to include your Head of Support and CTO if possible.\n\nLooking forward to exploring this further.\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Action Items\n\n**My Actions:**\n- [ ] Send Acme Corp case study - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule demo for Dec 15th, confirm attendees - **Due: By EOD Wednesday**\n- [ ] Loop in solutions engineering (cc: Mike) - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Request security documentation packet from compliance team - **Due: Tomorrow**\n- [ ] Send pricing calculator link - **Due: Today**\n- [ ] Schedule follow-up call for post-demo (week of Dec 18) - **Due: By Friday**\n\n**Customer Actions:**\n- Confirm Dec 15th demo time and attendees - **Expected: This week**\n- Review case study and pricing - **Expected: Before demo**\n- Provide API documentation for Zendesk integration - **Expected: By Dec 10**\n\n**Internal Actions:**\n- **Mike (Solutions Engineer):** Prepare custom demo focusing on Zendesk integration - **Due: Dec 12**\n- **Sarah (Legal):** Review their MSA redlines if deal progresses - **FYI for now**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Salesforce Update\n\n**Opportunity Details:**\n- **Company:** Acme Technologies, Inc.\n- **Size:** 500 employees, $50M ARR SaaS company\n- **Current spend on AI:** ~$150K/year (competitor solution)\n- **Potential ACV:** $200-250K (based on volume discussed)\n- **Decision timeline:** Pilot Q1 2024, full rollout Q2 2024\n- **Budget:** Confirmed allocated, part of 2024 ops budget\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- High escalation rate (35%) with current AI support tool\n- Poor context retention across conversations\n- Compliance concerns with current vendor's data handling\n- Integration limitations with existing tech stack\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Must integrate with Zendesk (primary support platform)\n- Connect to internal knowledge base (Confluence)\n- GDPR compliant (EU customers)\n- SOC 2 Type II required\n- API access for custom workflows\n\n**Stakeholders:**\n- **Jennifer Walsh** (VP Customer Success) - Champion, main contact\n- **David Chen** (CTO) - Technical buyer, final sign-off required\n- **Lisa Rodriguez** (Head of Support) - End user, needs to see demo\n- **Unknown** - Procurement/Legal (will surface during contract phase)\n\n**Next Steps \u0026 Timeline:**\n- Dec 15: Custom demo for Jennifer, David, and Lisa\n- Dec 18-22: Follow-up call to address questions\n- Jan 2024: Pilot program (1-2 support agents)\n- Feb 2024: Internal review and decision\n- Mar 2024: Rollout to full team (15 support agents)\n\n**Probability:** 60% - Strong interest, budget confirmed, clear pain, but need to win technical evaluation vs. current provider and one other competitor mentioned (Cohere)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Internal Team Note\n\n**To:** Mike (Solutions Engineering), Sarah (Legal - FYI)\n\n**Subject:** New opp needs demo support - Acme Technologies\n\nTeam,\n\nJust got off a great call with Acme Technologies (500 person SaaS company). They're frustrated with their current AI support solution and actively evaluating alternatives.\n\n**Ask for Mike:** Can you prepare a custom demo for Dec 15th? Key things to showcase:\n- Zendesk integration (this is critical)\n- How we maintain context across conversations\n- Knowledge base integration capabilities\n- Brief compliance/security overview\n\nAttendees will be:\n- Jennifer Walsh (VP CS) - our champion\n- David Chen (CTO) - technical decision maker\n- Lisa Rodriguez (Head of Support) - will be primary user\n\nDavid is technical and will ask detailed API questions. Jennifer mentioned they looked at Cohere, so we need to differentiate on quality and integration ease.\n\n**For Sarah (FYI):** They'll need SOC 2 and GDPR documentation during eval. Their legal will likely want to redline our MSA based on Jennifer's comments. Deal size is $200-250K ACV.\n\n**Red flag to watch:** Jennifer mentioned \"budget pressures\" once - confirmed budget exists but may indicate price sensitivity. She also said their current vendor contract ends in March, which creates urgency but also means we're racing the renewal cycle.\n\nLet me know if you need the full transcript or have questions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Resources to Send\n\n**Immediate (Today):**\n1. ✅ Acme Corp case study (customer support use case, similar scale)\n2. ✅ Pricing calculator link\n3. ✅ Zendesk integration one-pager\n\n**Before Demo (by Dec 12):**\n4. SOC 2 Type II certificate\n5. GDPR compliance documentation\n6. API documentation overview\n7. Sample Claude responses for support use cases\n\n**Post-Demo (if interest confirmed):**\n8. ROI calculator with custom inputs\n9. Implementation timeline template\n10. Customer references (2-3 similar companies)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Red Flags \u0026 Risks\n\n⚠️ **Budget Pressure Mentioned:** Jennifer said \"budget pressures\" - may indicate price sensitivity or competing priorities. Need to establish ROI clearly.\n\n⚠️ **Incumbent Renewal Timeline:** Current contract ends March 2024 - tight timeline could work for or against us. If we're not ready to close by February, they might just renew.\n\n⚠️ **CTO Not on First Call:** David (CTO) wasn't on this call - Jennifer will \"loop him in.\" Risk that he's not actually engaged yet. Need him on the demo to qualify properly.\n\n⚠️ **Competitor Awareness:** They're actively talking to Cohere. Need to understand what Cohere is offering and why we're better for this use case.\n\n⚠️ **Unclear Procurement Process:** Jennifer hasn't mentioned legal/procurement yet. Need to map out full decision process and timeline.\n\n**Mitigation Plan:**\n- Nail the ROI story with specific metrics from similar customers\n- Get David engaged ASAP (demo is critical)\n- Understand Cohere's proposal if possible\n- Map out full buying committee in next conversation"])
