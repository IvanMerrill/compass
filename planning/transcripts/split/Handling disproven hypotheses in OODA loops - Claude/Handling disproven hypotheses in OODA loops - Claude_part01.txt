Incident investigation MCP application
I'm thinking about the OODA loops and specifically the loops part. What happen when we disprove a hypothesis? This should be fed back in. But some interactions are human. What happens when we disprove a human led hypothesis? How do we feed this information back to the system and the human? We will need to start the investigation again but we have be evidence! As part of our scientific process we talked about in another chat, we should invoice this evidence and start again. How do we handle this? I'm interested in making sure we use disproven hypotheses in our continued investigation, making these available to the agents still investigating, how we differentiate human investigations, actions and disproven hypotheses in our reporting (for the post mortem), and how we handle explaining this information to the Human. We need a way of representing the investigation, the avenues we've taken etc, in a way that helps the human understand and digest what's happened, learn from the information, and continue the investigation better for it. I'm still thinking of a terminal interface. How can we achieve this?
Synthesized feedback loops, evidence preservation, and human-AI investigation differentiation strategies.
This is a really thoughtful question about the OODA loop in COMPASS, specifically about handling disproven hypotheses and the feedback mechanisms. Let me break down what Ivan is asking about:
Feedback loops for disproven hypotheses
- When a hypothesis is disproven (either by AI agents or by human investigation), that evidence needs to feed back into the system
Human vs AI differentiation
- Need to distinguish between human-led investigations and AI-led ones
Evidence preservation
- Disproven hypotheses contain valuable evidence that should inform continued investigation
- How do agents currently investigating benefit from disproven hypothesis evidence?
Post-mortem representation
- How to show this in the incident report
- How to present this complex information in a terminal interface that helps the human understand the investigation flow
This is really about the scientific method in action - disproven hypotheses are actually valuable data points that constrain the solution space. Let me search the project knowledge to see what we've already discussed about this.
Excellent question! This gets at the heart of how COMPASS learns and evolves during an investigation. Let me search our project knowledge for what we've discussed about the scientific method and feedback loops.

Synthesized investigation frameworks and terminal UI representation strategies.
Excellent! I found some great material about:
Learning teams vs RCA - which emphasizes learning from disproven paths
The importance of representing the investigation journey
State management and investigation flow
Now let me search for more about terminal UI and investigation representation specifically.
Perfect! This is a rich question that touches on several critical aspects of COMPASS. Let me break down a comprehensive approach to handling disproven hypotheses and representing the investigation journey.
You've identified something crucial:
disproven hypotheses are not failures—they're valuable evidence that constrains the solution space
. This aligns perfectly with the "Learning Teams" approach from your research, which shows that focusing on the investigation
(not just the outcome) generates 57% more system-focused improvements than traditional RCA.

Example: If "Database connection pool exhaustion" is disproven,
- Connection pool has available capacity
- Problem is NOT in connection acquisition
- Look elsewhere in the data path

generate_next_hypotheses
Generate hypotheses informed by what's been disproven
# Build context including disproven paths
Generate 3-5 new hypotheses that:
1. Explain the observations
2. DON'T repeat disproven paths
3. Respect the active constraints
4. Consider the evidence from failed investigations
Return as JSON array of hypotheses.

Key Benefits of This Approach
: Following the research showing Learning Teams generate 57% more system-focused improvements, we document
we investigated, not just the outcome
: Agents get explicit constraints from disproven hypotheses, preventing wasted effort on already-ruled-out paths
Human Decisions Are First-Class
: Clear differentiation in UI, timeline, and post-mortem between AI and human investigations
: Rich, scannable terminal UI that shows investigation state at a glance
: Disproven hypotheses are treated as valuable data, not failures
: Track costs of both successful and unsuccessful investigation paths
Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect? For example:
The terminal UI rendering with actual Rich library code?
How to handle conflicting evidence between disproven hypotheses?
Strategies for presenting this to humans during active investigation vs in post-mortem?
Let's talk more about your third point
Examined implementation obstacles in human decision documentation systems.
The user wants to dive deeper into "Human Decisions Are First-Class" - making sure that human decisions, actions, and disproven hypotheses are clearly differentiated and properly represented throughout the system.
This is a critical design choice that reflects the "human-in-the-loop" philosophy of COMPASS. Let me think about the key aspects:
