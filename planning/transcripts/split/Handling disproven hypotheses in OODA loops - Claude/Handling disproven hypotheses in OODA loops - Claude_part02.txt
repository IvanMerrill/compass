Human expertise is qualitatively different from AI pattern matching
Human decisions often involve context/intuition that AI doesn't have
Post-mortems need to show when humans overrode AI or chose unexpected paths
Learning culture means we need to understand WHY humans made decisions
Future incidents benefit from understanding human reasoning patterns
Visual distinction in UI (colors, icons, emphasis)
Metadata tracking (who, when, why, context)
Authority levels (human decisions can override AI)
Reasoning capture (why did the human choose this path?)
Outcome tracking (was the human right? wrong? partially right?)
Implementation challenges
Capturing human reasoning without being intrusive
Making it easy for humans to document their thinking
Balancing speed (humans are busy during incidents) with documentation
Showing respect for human expertise while also learning from mistakes
Not creating blame culture
Let me develop this comprehensively.
Excellent! Let's dive deep into
Human Decisions as First-Class Citizens
. This is absolutely critical because COMPASS is fundamentally about
human-AI collaboration
, not AI replacement.
Why Human Decisions Deserve Special Treatment
The research on Learning Teams shows something crucial:
how decisions are made matters as much as what decisions are made
. When we track human reasoning, we:
- Human intuition often picks up patterns AI misses
- Future responders can see "why did Sarah choose that path?"
- Humans see their decisions are valued, not just AI suggestions
- Focus on process, not individual failure
- Human decisions that disprove AI suggestions are training data
Core Design Principles
Explicit Human Authority Model
"""Who has authority at different decision points"""
# AI suggests, human can override
# AI can proceed (V1: not used)
"""Types of human decisions in the investigation"""
"hypothesis_selection"
# Which hypothesis to pursue
"hypothesis_rejection"
# Reject AI suggestion
# Request external data
INVESTIGATION_DIRECTION
"investigation_direction"
# Explicitly disagree with AI
# Escalate to senior engineer
A point where human judgment is required
Captures the full context and reasoning
# Context presented to human
# Hypotheses, actions, etc.
# What the investigation state was
# "high", "medium", "low"
# Did human agree with AI?
if_disagreement_reason
# Outcome tracking (filled in later)
# How long human took
additional_data_requested
# Other people consulted
A hypothesis investigation led by a human
Different from AI investigation in key ways
investigation_strategy
# How human planned to test it
# Why this needed human expertise
# Data gathered by human
external_data_collected
# Things human noticed
# kubectl, curl, manual queries, etc.
# "proven", "disproven", "inconclusive"
# Unique to human investigations
tacit_knowledge_applied
# Intuition, experience, context
# Input from teammates
was_hypothesis_disproven
# What should AI learn?
# What should future responders know?
