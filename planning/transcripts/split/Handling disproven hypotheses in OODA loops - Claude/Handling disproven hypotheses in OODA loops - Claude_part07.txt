7. Blameless Retrospective System
When a human's decision leads to an unexpected outcome (hypothesis disproven, required pivot), we conduct a
blameless retrospective
Validates the human's reasoning
- Shows why it was reasonable given context
Identifies system factors
- What information was missing/misleading?
- What should the system improve?
- Focus on "what can we learn" not "who was wrong"
There are no "wrong" decisions, only unexpected outcomes that teach us about system complexity.
Stored for future pattern recognition
# How to differentiate
7.3 Retrospective Analyzer
CRITICAL: Explain WHY the human's hypothesis was reasonable
This validates their thinking and focuses on context
f"AI also recommended this hypothesis with "
confidence based on: "
f"Observed symptoms included: "
# Context at time of decision
f"had already been ruled out"
"Given the available information, this hypothesis was reasonable because:\n"
Identify SYSTEM factors that contributed to unexpected outcome
f"Pattern recognition: Add '
f"as confusable with '
f"distinguish by checking: "
"Improve explanation: AI was correct but human chose differently. "
"Better explain AI reasoning to build trust."
f"Surface critical data: Ensure these are visible: "
"Create fast disambiguation check for this scenario"
f"Definitively ruled out '
f"with symptoms similar to '
# Helper methods (simplified signatures)
# Implementation using LLM
# Calculate time from decision to next decision or resolution
# Calculate cost of investigating this path
# Query past incidents database
# Check if critical data was missing
# Check if metrics were misleading
# Check if symptoms could indicate multiple causes
# Check if relevant docs were missing
# Get data available at specific time
# Get data that revealed root cause
# Use LLM to identify what would have changed decision
# Generate observability recommendations
# Generate documentation recommendations
# Generate process recommendations
7.4 Optional Human Reflection Interface
# Guide through reflection
"""Show the system-focused retrospective, framed positively"""
# Why it was reasonable (VALIDATE)
# Value of learning (POSITIVE FRAME)
"""Guide human through reflection with supportive questions"""
