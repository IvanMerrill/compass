# Detect and reframe blame language
I've reframed that slightly to focus on learning rather than blame.
Instead of 'Who broke this?', we ask 'What can we learn?'
"""Reframe questions to promote learning"""
"What factors contributed to this?"
"Why didn't you catch this?"
"What made this hard to detect?"
"Whose fault is this?"
"What can we learn from this?"
"Why did you do that?"
"What made that seem like the right choice?"
"Who made this mistake?"
"How did our system allow this?"

"What would help next time?"

10. Integration Points
10.1 Orchestrator Integration
Interface to COMPASS orchestrator and agent system
Manages all AI agent interactions
"""Start new investigation with orchestrator"""
"""Get current hypotheses from orchestrator"""
submit_human_decision

10.2 Knowledge Base Integration
Interface to enterprise knowledge and learning repository
Provides context and historical patterns
"""Retrieve relevant historical context"""
# Search for similar incidents

14.2 Training and Documentation
Materials for user onboarding and training
# COMPASS Quick Start
## For Everyone (No Training Required)
Just type what you need:
- "What's happening with the database?"
- "Show me recent incidents for user-api"
COMPASS will guide you through the investigation.
Use commands for more control:
- `hypothesis add "Cache invalidation issue"`
- `focus database --confidence high`
- `explain reasoning --verbose`
## Remember: It's About Learning, Not Blame
We ask "What happened?" not "Who did it?"
We ask "What made sense?" not "Why did you fail?"

15.1 Key Performance Indicators
'Percentage of incidents using COMPASS'
'> 90% within 3 months'
'Incident tickets with COMPASS investigation'
'Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)'
'Time from alert to resolution'
'Improvements per incident'
'> 7.5 average (Learning Teams benchmark)'
'Count of implemented improvements'
'System-focused actions'
'> 57% (Learning Teams benchmark)'
'Ratio of system vs person actions'
'Incident reporting rate'
'200% increase (more psychological safety)'
'Near-misses and minor incidents reported'
'User satisfaction score'
'Post-investigation survey'
This architecture provides a comprehensive interface system that makes COMPASS accessible to everyone while preserving power for experts. By prioritizing natural language interaction, psychological safety, and complete auditability, we create a system that not only reduces MTTR but fundamentally improves organizational culture.
The interface serves as more than just a communication layer - it's an active participant in building a learning organization, where every incident becomes an opportunity for system improvement rather than blame assignment.
Through progressive enhancement and adaptive complexity, we ensure that a Product Owner can get help immediately while a Senior Engineer can dive deep into scientific investigation. Most importantly, every interaction is captured, reasoned about, and learned from, building an ever-improving knowledge base that makes future investigations faster and more effective.
This is how we change enterprise culture: one conversation at a time, one investigation at a time, one learning at a time.
