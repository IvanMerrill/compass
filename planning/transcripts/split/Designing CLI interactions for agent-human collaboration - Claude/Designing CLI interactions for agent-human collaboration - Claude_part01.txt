Incident investigation MCP application
I'd like to talk about how the uhman interacts with the system, it's very important. I'm thinking CLI so far, as we're talking about engineers so this makes the most sense. But how will they do this? Will it be mainly free text? Or menus? We want to allow engineers to add useful information to the system, but not get sidetracked with useless information, or get agents sidetracked. Similarly, we want to keep the interface simple but convey complex information. We talked about this in the other chat where we talked about how we represent human interactions and the avenues of investigation that ultimately don't prove successful. Let's do some research in the best way for humans to interact with agents, and the best way for there to be an exchange of information between the agent and human. These interactions will prove critical in helping the investigation move in the right direction quickly, so it's important we take the time to think about it. IS there any research on this? Please can you help me as a senior AI interactions researcher, so that we can tailor this interaction to the situation to make it as effective as possible. Thank you!
Synthesized human-AI collaboration research for CLI incident investigation interfaces.
The user is asking about human-agent interaction design for COMPASS, specifically focused on how engineers will interact with the AI agents during incident investigations. They're looking for research-backed approaches to design effective human-AI collaboration interfaces. Let me search for relevant research on this topic.
Key aspects they're interested in:
CLI interface (since it's for engineers)
Balance between free text vs structured menus
Preventing information overload or distractions
Conveying complex information simply
Capturing failed investigation paths as learning artifacts
Research on human-agent interaction patterns
Human-AI interaction research
Command-line interfaces for AI systems
Incident response human-computer interaction
Cognitive load in human-AI collaboration
I'll help you research the best practices for human-agent interaction in your COMPASS system. This is indeed critical - the interface design can make or break the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration during high-pressure incident investigations.

Synthesized research to architect optimal human-agent interaction design.
Excellent research gathered! Now let me compile my comprehensive response about human-agent interaction design for COMPASS based on all this research.
Based on my research into human-AI interaction patterns, cognitive load theory, and incident response best practices, I can provide comprehensive guidance for designing COMPASS's human-agent interface. This is a critical design decision that will significantly impact the system's effectiveness.
Key Research Insights for COMPASS Interface Design
The CLI Advantage for Engineers
CLI interfaces are preferred by technical professionals because they offer greater speed, flexibility, and control, allowing complex commands to be executed with a few keystrokes and enabling easy automation through scripting
GUI vs. CLI: What Are the Differences? | Shardeum +2
. With practice, CLI configuration can be far faster compared to GUI, and network administrators have traditionally used CLI for network management
. This aligns perfectly with your target audience of engineers who are already comfortable with command-line tools.
However, GUIs provide visual cues and conventions that allow first-time users to get devices running quickly with basic configuration, particularly helpful when dealing with a broad range of devices
. This suggests a hybrid approach might be optimal.
Mixed-Initiative Systems: The Sweet Spot
Mixed-initiative systems give AI agents responsibility for simpler, repetitive tasks while preserving human control over decision-making, treating AI as a participating agent rather than just a tool
. The agency dimension requires describing how control is decided over the course of collaboration, not just who is generally in charge
AI agents can get incident commanders three steps ahead by bypassing the need to orchestrate data gathering across teams and tools, delivering intelligence briefs that shift cognitive load from "What do we know?" to "What's our best path forward?"
Cognitive Load Management
The more elements on an interface, the greater the cognitive load on users - when cognitive load is high, it consumes most attentional resources, leaving little for processing task-irrelevant information
. In mixed reality environments, operation time increased by 49% under high cognitive load compared to low-load conditions
Eye-tracking research shows that fixation frequency, saccadic rate, and pupil diameter can predict task difficulty during initial interaction phases, suggesting the importance of the first few moments of interface engagement
Recommended Interface Architecture for COMPASS

> What patterns do you see in the database queries?
Primary CLI interface for speed and scripting
Progressive disclosure of information
Visual progress indicators for parallel agent work
Optional GUI dashboard for complex visualizations
"Teach-me" mode showing CLI equivalents of any GUI actions
2. Structured Input with Intelligent Flexibility
Structured data enables automated defenses and scales far beyond manual management, but lacks the rich narrative context that unstructured data provides about the "who, what, where, when, and why" behind an attack
Recommended Approach:
# Core structured commands
"Database timeout causing cascade failure"
"DB connection pool exhaustion on Mondays"
# Natural language overlay for complex reasoning
explain why "The pattern suggests connection pool exhaustion
because we see linear growth
active connections without
corresponding query completion rates"
# Structured templates for common patterns
template connection_leak
### **3. Information Exchange Patterns**
incident response requires perception of hazards
comprehension of their meaning
projection of future status
Design the interface to support
Progressive Information Disclosure
Contextual Understanding
Cache invalidation storm
Previous incident INC
No corresponding application deployments
If hypothesis correct
If hypothesis incorrect
Potential full outage
Implement cache throttling NOW
4. Human-AI Dialogue Management
Unstructured interviews allow for spontaneity and questions to develop during the course of interaction based on responses, with open-ended questions enabling respondents to shift direction and bring in unanticipated information
Adaptive Questioning Strategy:
structured_investigation
hypothesis_validation
# Start structured, become more open as uncertainty increases
pattern_match_confidence
### **5. Preventing Information Overload**
escalating only truly critical issues requiring human intervention
allowing experts to focus on
impact problems instead of false alarms
Smart Filtering Interface
# Intelligent summarization
Database connection spike at
Payment service timeout cascade starting
Unusual retry pattern
### **6. Failed Path Documentation**
Disproven hypotheses are valuable learning artifacts that inform future investigations
Killed blocking query → RESOLVED
All nodes responding to ping
Network alerts were false positive
Memory profiler results
"false-positive-network"
7. Cognitive Handoffs and Context Preservation
AI can provide concise, relevant answers to "Have we seen similar issues before?" within seconds, pulling context from past incidents
# Generate concise briefing for shift changes
### **8. Trust Calibration Through Transparency**
AI agents analyze incidents
actions staying under analyst control
guidance saves valuable time
Application deployment at
due to missing CPU spike
"No corresponding memory pressure"
Adjusting confidence to
Alternative hypothesis
checking connection pool
Implementation Recommendations
Start Simple, Evolve Systematically
: Basic CLI with structured commands
: Add context injection and learning capture
: Introduce natural language overlay
: Visual dashboard for pattern recognition
: Predictive and proactive suggestions
Measurement and Adaptation
Track these metrics to optimize the interface:
Time to first hypothesis
Hypothesis validation rate
False path exploration time
Context switch frequency
Command completion usage
Natural vs. structured input ratio
Critical Success Factors
Human-AI synergy occurs when output outperforms both humans and AI alone, but achieving this requires redesigning the whole process of how they work together, not just dividing subtasks
Preserve engineer agency
while accelerating investigation
Support both novice and expert
Learn from every interaction
when confidence is low
for compliance and learning
This human-first, CLI-centric approach with intelligent augmentation will allow COMPASS to achieve its goal of reducing MTTR by 67-90% while maintaining the trust and control that engineers require in critical incident response scenarios.
so what about me, as a less skilled PO, can I use the tool and simply ask a question like:
, please investigate the issue and help me resolve the incident'
I'd like to be able to get anyone using the tool fairly easily. It's great to have a really detailed engineering setup via the CLI, but I also want to keep it simple. If engineers have to spend a long time learning the tool then they could have just learnt to use the observability tool in the first place! It needs to be simple, and allow engineers to ask questions about the state of their services, thus staying true to the principles of observability. We allow engineers to ask questions or ask for investigations and provide scientific rigour to get the answers. Let's consider all of this, and review the project documents because there's lots there about safe human interactions and promoting a good culture. Let's review all of this information and identify the three best ways to implement all of these ideas. For each of idea, present a structured view of the idea (enough for you to take if forward and flesh it out as intended), provide pros and cons, detailed reasoning for why you've presented the idea and then a rating for complexity to implement the idea, ease of use for engineers (and POs!), cost and sustainability to run the idea, ability to improve culture. Then we can review these and decide if any of them are worth continuing and making into the interface for our system
Synthesized accessibility needs with engineering rigor and cultural principles.
The user is making an excellent point - the system needs to be accessible to less technical users like Product Owners (POs) while still providing the depth that engineers need. They want to maintain simplicity while enabling both natural language queries and sophisticated investigations. Let me review the project documents to understand the cultural and safety aspects better, then propose three implementation approaches.
Let me first check the project documents to understand the existing architecture and principles around human interaction and culture.
I'll review the project documents to understand the cultural and safety aspects, then propose three implementation approaches that balance simplicity with power.

Synthesized cultural principles to architect three balanced interface implementations.
Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project's cultural values around Learning Teams, human decisions as first-class entities, and the need to balance sophisticated engineering capabilities with simplicity and accessibility. The project emphasizes:
Learning Teams methodology over traditional RCA - 114% more improvement opportunities
Human decisions as first-class entities with rich context capture
Psychological safety and blame-free investigation
The importance of both structured and unstructured approaches
Mixed-initiative systems where AI supports but doesn't replace human judgment
Let me now propose three interface implementations that balance:
Simplicity for POs and less experienced engineers
Power for experienced engineers
Cultural promotion through Learning Teams
