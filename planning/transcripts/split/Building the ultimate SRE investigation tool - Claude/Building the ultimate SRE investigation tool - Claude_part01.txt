Incident investigation MCP application
we talked before about agent behaviour refinement, we've talked about the interface. We've gone into detail about scientific rigour and pzychological safety. We've added a feature for post mortems. We have made sure our system is extensible and can add new MCP servers, new agents, new data sources. Is there anything else you can think that we would need in order to make this the ultimate SRE investigation tool? I'm trying to think of everything we could need, every major feature, up front so we can make sure we build this right the first time, so your expertise as an SRE trained in incident investigations and improving enterprise reliabulity culture is really important to me
Inventoried existing features and synthesized fifteen critical capabilities.
The user is asking me to think comprehensively about what features would make COMPASS the ultimate SRE investigation tool. They want to identify all major features upfront to build it right the first time. Let me think through this systematically based on my knowledge of SRE practices, incident investigation, and what we've already covered in their architecture.
What they already have:
Agent behavior refinement (3-tier system)
Interface architecture
Scientific rigor and psychological safety
Post-mortem generation
Extensibility (MCP servers, agents, data sources)
Learning Teams methodology
Contributing causes analysis
Human-in-the-loop design
Let me think about what gaps might exist for the "ultimate" SRE investigation tool:
Incident Timeline Reconstruction
- Automatic timeline generation with multiple data source correlation
- Linking incidents to recent changes/deployments
Similar Incident Detection
- Pattern matching against historical incidents
- Suggested remediation steps based on known patterns
Capacity Planning Integration
- Understanding if incidents are capacity-related
- Real-time service dependency understanding
Business Impact Analysis
- Translating technical incidents to business metrics
Communication Orchestration
- Managing stakeholder updates during incidents
Knowledge Base Evolution
- Learning from each incident to improve future investigations
Simulation/Chaos Engineering Integration
- Testing hypotheses safely
- Understanding the financial impact of incidents and investigations
- Identifying patterns that precede incidents
- Supporting multiple teams/organizations
Skills Matrix Integration
- Knowing who to escalate to based on expertise
- Automated compliance reporting for incidents
Let me search the project knowledge to see what's already been covered and what might be missing.
Looking at your comprehensive COMPASS architecture, you've built an incredibly robust foundation. Let me search the project knowledge to understand what features might still be missing for the ultimate SRE investigation tool.

Inventoried existing capabilities and identified fifteen enhancement opportunities.
Based on my comprehensive search of the project knowledge, I can see that you've covered a tremendous amount of ground already. Let me think about what critical features might still be missing for the ultimate SRE investigation tool that aren't explicitly covered in your documentation:
What's already covered:
Timeline reconstruction and event sequencing
Post-mortem generation with Learning Teams methodology
Scientific investigation framework
Multi-agent coordination
Cost tracking and optimization
Integration with observability stacks (LGTM)
Enterprise knowledge integration (GitHub, Confluence, Slack, PagerDuty)
Pattern recognition and learning systems
Human-in-the-loop design with psychological safety
Contributing causes analysis (not root cause)
Audit trails and compliance
Interface architecture with natural language
Extensibility framework for new agents/data sources
What might be missing or could be enhanced:
Real-time incident collaboration features
- Multi-human coordination
Dependency mapping and service mesh understanding
Change correlation and deployment tracking
(mentioned but not detailed)
Simulation/sandbox capabilities
for hypothesis testing
Business impact translation
Predictive/proactive capabilities
Service Level Objective (SLO) integration
Capacity and performance baselines
External vendor/third-party service monitoring
Incident handoff and shift management
Skills-based escalation routing
Customer impact assessment
Automated remediation capabilities
Security incident integration
Multi-region/multi-cloud coordination
Based on my review of your comprehensive COMPASS architecture, you've built an incredibly solid foundation. However, there are several critical features that could elevate this to the ultimate SRE investigation tool:
Real-Time Service Dependency Mapping
While you have specialist agents, you're missing dynamic dependency discovery:
Live service mesh visualization
showing request flows during the incident
Automatic dependency chain analysis
- which downstream services are affected?
Third-party API dependency tracking
- is AWS, Stripe, or Auth0 having issues?
- where does this data come from and where does it go?
This would help answer "WHERE is it happening?" more comprehensively.
Change Correlation Engine
You mention recent changes but need deeper correlation:
Multi-source change tracking
: deployments, feature flags, config changes, infrastructure modifications, database migrations, DNS changes
based on historical incident correlation
Automatic rollback suggestions
when high-correlation changes are detected
Change approval chain visibility
- who approved what and when?
Research shows 70-80% of incidents correlate with recent changes.
Business Impact Translator
Convert technical metrics to business language:
Revenue impact calculation
- "This incident costs $X per minute"
Customer segment analysis
- "Affecting 15% of enterprise customers in EU"
SLA/SLO breach tracking
Regulatory impact assessment
- "GDPR data availability requirement at risk"
This bridges the gap between engineering and executive stakeholders.
Simulation & Safe Testing Environment
Test hypotheses without production impact:
Chaos engineering integration
- safely reproduce conditions
Shadow traffic replay
- test fixes against recorded problem traffic
- "What would happen if we increased connection pool?"
Automated canary analysis
for remediation validation
This reduces the risk of making incidents worse during investigation.
Predictive Incident Prevention
Move from reactive to proactive:
Anomaly pattern detection
- "These metrics preceded the last 3 incidents"
- "Database will hit limits in 4 hours at current rate"
Weak signal correlation
- identify leading indicators before incidents
Scheduled event risk assessment
- "Black Friday traffic may trigger this issue"
Multi-Human Coordination Layer
Real incidents often involve multiple people:
Role-based investigation views
- IC sees different data than responders
- seamless context transfer between shifts
Parallel investigation tracking
- multiple people checking different hypotheses
Skills-based auto-escalation
- "This needs our Kafka expert, paging Jane"
Decision consensus mechanisms
- when multiple experts disagree
Customer Impact Intelligence
Understand real user experience:
Synthetic monitoring correlation
- which user journeys are broken?
Real User Monitoring (RUM) integration
- actual customer experience data
Support ticket correlation
- are customers reporting this issue?
Social media monitoring
- is this incident visible on Twitter?
Customer communication automation
- draft status page updates
Automated Remediation Capabilities
For well-understood issues:
- execute approved remediation steps
Self-healing triggers
- automatic restart/failover for known patterns
Resource scaling automation
- add capacity when limits approached
Circuit breaker management
- automatically trip/reset based on conditions
Progressive rollback orchestration
- systematically rollback recent changes
With human approval gates for anything risky.
Security Incident Correlation
Many incidents have security implications:
