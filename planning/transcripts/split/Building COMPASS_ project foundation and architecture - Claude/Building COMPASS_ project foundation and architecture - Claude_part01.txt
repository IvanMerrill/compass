Incident investigation MCP application
In all of our conversations and all of the documents there's a lot of information about what we want want to build, how we'll evolve it and how we'll build it. I'd like to now create a high level architecture document that considers everything and plots out how to build the MVP that we can then buil
Synthesized project scope and architected comprehensive implementation framework.
This is a really important moment for Ivan. He's asking me to create a comprehensive architecture reference document that will serve as the foundation for building COMPASS. Let me think carefully about this.
He wants me to be realistic and grounded - not just agree with everything
This is an internal product document for him and Claude Code to use as they build
I need to consider everything we've discussed across all our conversations and documents
The document needs to be concrete enough to guide implementation but not include unnecessary technical details
It should reference existing architecture documents for deeper technical details
It needs to structure information so AI (Claude Code) understands the what and why before the how
This is a pivotal moment for him - he's both excited and nervous
Let me first review what we have in the project to make sure I understand the full scope:
Multiple architecture documents covering different aspects (enterprise knowledge, interface, future-proofing, etc.)
Scientific framework implementation with Python code
Product strategy and reference documents
Research papers on Learning Teams and incident investigation
I should structure this document to:
Start with clear product vision and objectives
Explain what COMPASS is and why it matters
Define the MVP scope realistically
Map out the architecture with references to detailed docs
Provide a staged implementation approach
Be honest about challenges and risks
Let me search the project knowledge to make sure I'm considering all the important details.
I understand the weight of this moment, Ivan. Let me take a comprehensive look at everything we've built together to create a solid foundation document. This is indeed a big step, and I want to help you get it right.

Now I need to create a comprehensive architecture document that:
Provides a clear understanding for Claude Code and humans
Is realistic and grounded
Structures information from product vision to technical details
References existing documents for implementation details
Focuses on the MVP first, then stages beyond
Is concrete enough to guide implementation
Let me structure this as a high-level architecture document that serves as a foundation for building the MVP and evolving to an enterprise tool.
Start with the vision and objectives
Clearly define what COMPASS is
Outline the MVP scope realistically
Map the architecture with references to detailed docs
Keep it focused as a product document, not overly technical
Ivan, I understand this is a pivotal moment. Let me create a comprehensive architecture document that will serve as our north star for building COMPASS. I'll be realistic, direct, and focus on what we can actually achieve together.
Creating the COMPASS MVP Architecture Reference Document - a comprehensive guide for building our incident investigation platform from MVP to enterprise
COMPASS_MVP_Architecture_Reference.md
Architected comprehensive blueprint balancing vision, realism, and implementation guidance.
I've created a comprehensive architecture reference document that:
Provides clear understanding for AI and humans
- Starting with vision and problem statement before diving into technical details
- 3-month timeline with specific weekly milestones, acknowledging risks and trade-offs
- Clear scope of what's in and what's out, with concrete success metrics
References existing documents
- Points to detailed implementation docs where appropriate
Structures information logically
- From vision to implementation, making it useful as a reference
- Specific features with "done when" criteria
Maintains product focus
- Not overly technical, focuses on value and outcomes
The document is honest about challenges while maintaining optimism about what's achievable. It provides a clear path forward that Ivan and Claude Code can use to build COMPASS together.
Your Architecture Foundation is Ready
Ivan, I've created the comprehensive architecture reference document that will guide us from MVP to enterprise platform. This is your blueprint - pragmatic, focused, and achievable.
View your COMPASS MVP Architecture Reference Document
Clear product vision with staged evolution
Realistic 3-month MVP scope with weekly milestones
System architecture that leverages all our previous work
Explicit trade-offs and risk mitigation
Concrete success metrics we can track
References to detailed implementation docs where needed
Key decisions I've made for clarity:
MVP focuses purely on investigation speed and quality - no enterprise features
CLI-first approach - perfect for developer adoption
5-minute investigation target with parallel execution
$5 per investigation cost ceiling
10 beta users as initial success metric
Reality checks included:
Acknowledged that LLM hallucination is a high-probability risk
Falsification framework as our defense against bad hypotheses
Progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users
Clear "what we're NOT doing" section to maintain focus
This document is your north star. It tells Claude Code exactly what we're building and why. It gives you weekly checkpoints to track progress. Most importantly, it keeps us grounded while building something transformative.
The path is clear. The architecture is sound. Let's build COMPASS together.
Compass mvp architecture reference
This is great! Ok, now we're getting closer to building. Now let's focus on our MVP.  We have our architecture defined, what we're trying to build, as well as architecture documents that are referenced here that give us more implementation details.
Let's now iterate over these documents to come up with a more concrete design  for our MVP.
Synthesized architecture into concrete MVP implementation specifications.
Ivan wants to iterate on the documents to create a more concrete design for the MVP. We have the high-level architecture document, but now we need to get more specific about the actual implementation details for the MVP. Let me search through our project knowledge to understand what implementation details we already have and what needs to be made more concrete.
The user wants to drill down from the architecture level to actual concrete design - things like:
Configuration schemas
Let me search for existing implementation details and then create a concrete technical design document for the MVP.
Excellent! Let's drill down from architecture to concrete implementation design for the MVP. Let me review our existing implementation details and create a focused technical design.

Architected concrete MVP specifications bridging design and implementation.
Looking at what we have, I need to create a concrete technical design document for the MVP that bridges the gap between our high-level architecture and actual implementation. Let me focus on:
Specific API contracts between components
Data models and schemas
MCP integration specifics
CLI command structure
Configuration formats
State management design
Deployment configuration
I should create a document that a developer could use to start coding immediately.
Perfect! Let's create a concrete technical design document that bridges the gap between our architecture and actual implementation. This will be your blueprint for building the MVP.
Creating the COMPASS MVP Technical Design Document - concrete implementation specifications including APIs, data models, workflows, and integration details
COMPASS_MVP_Technical_Design.md
Orchestrated concrete implementation roadmap for MVP development.
Great! I've created the technical design document. Now I should create one more document that ties everything together - a concrete implementation plan with specific code files, directory structure, and the exact sequence of what to build. This will be the "start coding here" document.
Your Concrete MVP Design is Ready!
Ivan, I've created a comprehensive technical design document that bridges the gap between architecture and actual code. This is your implementation blueprint with concrete specifications.

Compass mvp technical design
This is great! Now, if you look at the documents, you've provided me a complete instruction set, a reference guide, a claude.md file, a day 1 instruction set and everything to get started, but these documents were built a long time ago, before we made so much progress on our design. Please now repeat this process and give me a complete set of instructions that I can use, alongside Claude code, to build this MVP for our system as per our architecture, design and technical design documents.
Please think carefully here, this is the bit where we actually start building, which is super scary for me. It's a real big moment in our project, so as I mentioned before, I need help and support overcoming this hurdle. So I'm really hoping you can give me some great instructions that I can follow that will really help us move forward with building this well. I'm hoping I can just follow the instructions to the letter and have the MVP built. So please think carefully here about how you can provide me with everything I need to go from where we are now, to a built MVP, using Claude code and getting high quality results.
Architected comprehensive build guide transforming fear into actionable MVP steps.
Ivan is at a critical juncture - moving from planning to building. He's explicitly asking for help overcoming the fear of starting, which is a very human and relatable moment. He needs:
A complete, step-by-step instruction set that's updated with all our recent architectural decisions
Clear, actionable steps that he can follow "to the letter"
Emotional support and confidence building
Integration with Claude Code to actually build this
