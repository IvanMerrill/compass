It's Not Enterprise Software - It's Developer Tools
Enterprise Software Playbook
(what I was critiquing):
6-month implementation
Professional services
Developer Tools Playbook
(what you're actually building):
The Refined Architecture Strengths
MCP as Integration Layer
: Community-maintained integrations
: New data source = new MCP server, not your problem
: Works with any observability stack
Consultancy-Funded Development
: Revenue while building
: Learn real patterns from real incidents
: Success stories from consultancy become case studies
Scientific Framework + Learning Teams
: Not just "AI reads logs"
: Hard to copy the methodology
: Actually improves incident culture
What to Double Down On
The "Single Engineer Success" Toolkit
# 30-minute setup to value
-sSL https://compass.dev/install
compass investigate --incident
The Learning Flywheel
"""Gets smarter with every incident"""
# What did COMPASS miss?
# What did the engineer check that COMPASS didn't?
# What was the actual root cause?
# How can we detect this faster next time?
# This learning helps EVERY user
update_global_patterns
improve_hypothesis_generation
Cost Transparency as a Feature
investigation_summary
cost_per_minute_saved
"0.3% of engineer hourly rate"
Engineers LOVE metrics. Show them the efficiency.
The "COMPASS Moments" Collection
Document every time COMPASS finds something non-obvious:
"Found correlation between deploy 3 hours ago and current issue"
"Identified memory leak pattern across 3 services"
"Connected network blip to database connection storm"
These become your marketing material.
What's Actually Missing (Revised)
Local Development Experience
# This needs to be PERFECT
compass run --local --model
# Should work offline after initial setup

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement Path**
Suggested queries you can run
Let users choose their comfort level.
The Real Path to Success
Find your first true believer
- The engineer who gets it immediately
Make them wildly successful
- 10x their incident response
- Their patterns become your templates
Consultancy with 2-3 companies
- Refine through real usage
Open source the framework
- Let community build MCP servers
- Support, hosted version, enterprise features
You're building this right. The approach is:
(bottom-up, engineer-focused)
(consultancy funds development)
(BYOK, self-hosted, SaaS options)
(MCP solves integration, scientific framework differentiates)
The things I critiqued aren't bugs, they're features:
Full LGTM integration = comprehensive value prop
One user focus = real feedback loop
Consultancy model = funded customer development
BYOK approach = enterprise security solved
You're not building enterprise software. You're building a developer tool that enterprises will end up buying.
That's a much better strategy. Carry on.
Great! Thanks for the confidence boost. I think you do raise an interesting point though. We've talked before about being able to add enterprise knowledge, we've written Thimo a whole document in fact. But this implies a more central deployment model after we've achieved developer popularity. We need to think about how this would be deployed in an enterprise so they they can verbally benefit from knowledge, post mortems etc but also acknowledge that there exists tribal knowledge in an organisation because they move in tribes and what is relevant to one isn't necessarily relevant to another. Considering this, let's consider this transition to a central deployment model now so we at least know what it would look like. If we're charging enterprises, what are we charging for? Let's consider this to build an overall product strategy based on our dev tools adoption strategy
Mapped developer-to-enterprise adoption trajectory and identified centralized deployment value propositions.
This is a great evolution of thinking. They're recognizing that while bottom-up developer adoption is the entry strategy, eventually enterprises will want centralized value - shared learning, knowledge management, post-mortem patterns, etc. But they also recognize the tribal nature of engineering orgs.
Let me think about the progression:
Individual developer using COMPASS locally
Team adopting it informally
Multiple teams using it
Enterprise wants central deployment for shared learning
But still needs team/tribal boundaries
This is similar to how GitHub, Datadog, or Slack evolved - start as developer tools, become enterprise platforms.
The value proposition shifts:
Individual: Faster incident resolution
Team: Shared patterns and runbooks
Enterprise: Organizational learning, compliance, knowledge retention
What would enterprises pay for:
Centralized learning across incidents
Post-mortem automation and storage
Knowledge management and retention
Compliance/audit trails
RBAC and team boundaries
SLOs/metrics on incident response
Training new engineers
The tribal knowledge point is crucial - Platform team knowledge != Product team knowledge, even in the same company.
Excellent strategic thinking! You're recognizing the natural evolution from developer tool to enterprise platform, while respecting the reality of engineering tribes. Let's map out this transition.
The Product Evolution Journey
Stage 1: Individual Developer Tool (Months 1-6)
Local laptop / personal cloud
Personal productivity
Free (open source core)
Personal patterns only
Stage 2: Team Adoption (Months 6-12)
Team's Kubernetes namespace
10 engineers on same team
Team knowledge sharing
Team license ($500/month per team)
Stage 3: Multi-Team / Tribe (Year 2)
Shared infrastructure per "tribe"
Multiple related teams (e.g.
Tribe license ($2k/month per tribe)
service interdependencies
Stage 4: Enterprise Platform (Year 2+)
Centralized with federation
Entire engineering org
Organizational learning
Enterprise ($10k+/month)
Global patterns + tribal boundaries
The Tribal Knowledge Architecture
Knowledge flows UP for learning, DOWN for context
But maintains tribal boundaries
# Available to everyone
"compliance_requirements"
"platform_fundamentals"
# Shared within tribe only
"infrastructure_runbooks"
"payment_provider_quirks"
# Team-specific context
"service_specific_patterns"
# Individual engineer patterns
"personal_debugging_steps"
