Incident investigation MCP application
ok, I think we've had a lot of very important conversations that contain a lot of important design decisions. We've built a number of great documents and added them to the project. In particular there's a number of important architectural documents that contain entire features and designs and things we think are important to our system. I'm feeling pretty confident that this could be a really good enterprise tol. However I'm a PO so I'm super optimistic. I want you to review this now as a skeptical AI systems architect, with a background in Enterprise SRE, and give me realistic feedback on whether this project is feasible, in terms of it being possible to build everything I want and in terms of it actually being something useful for engineers. If people aren't thinking 'I am going to use Ivan's tool' when they get an alert then it's not achieving what we need it to in order for us to sell it. Help keep me honest please. Review everything in this project thoroughly and provide a detailed critique, with recommendations on what we can do to make this project something that will land in enterprises. Don't hold back please. I don't want you to just agree with me, we need to be honest with eachother if we're going to make this a success
Marshaled architectural review framework to deliver candid enterprise feasibility assessment.
The user wants me to do a critical review of the COMPASS project from the perspective of a skeptical AI systems architect with enterprise SRE background. They want honest feedback on:
Feasibility - can this actually be built as designed?
Usefulness - will engineers actually use it when they get alerts?
Enterprise readiness - what needs to change to make it land in enterprises?
They explicitly don't want me to hold back or just agree with them. This is a perfect opportunity to use the project_knowledge_search tool to review all the architectural documents and provide a thorough critique.
Let me start by searching for the architectural documents and reviewing the overall system design.
I'll conduct a thorough architectural review of COMPASS from a skeptical enterprise SRE perspective. Let me examine all the architectural documents and design decisions to give you the honest, critical feedback you need.

Assembled critical framework to evaluate project feasibility and enterprise viability.
Now I have a comprehensive view of the COMPASS project. Let me analyze this from a skeptical enterprise SRE perspective and provide honest, critical feedback. I'll review the feasibility, enterprise readiness, and whether engineers will actually use this when they get an alert.
Key things I need to critique:
Technical feasibility - can this actually be built as designed?
Real-world practicality - will engineers actually use this?
Enterprise readiness - security, compliance, multi-tenancy, etc.
Cost/ROI - is this economically viable?
Integration complexity
Cultural fit in enterprises
Missing pieces or naive assumptions
Honest Architecture Review: The Good, The Bad, and The Reality Check
After thoroughly reviewing all the COMPASS documentation and architecture, I'll give you the unfiltered truth from an enterprise SRE perspective. You've built something impressive conceptually, but there are significant challenges to address before this becomes a real enterprise tool.
The Good (What You Got Right)
Scientific Framework is Genuinely Innovative
The hypothesis validation with systematic disproof attempts is brilliant. This isn't just "ChatGPT reads logs" - it's a fundamentally different approach that could actually reduce false positives. The audit trail generation is enterprise-gold.
Learning Teams Methodology Integration
Your rejection of root cause analysis in favor of contributing causes shows real understanding of modern incident response. The 114% more improvement actions stat will resonate with mature engineering orgs.
Human-in-the-Loop Design
Starting at Level 1 autonomy is smart. You're not trying to replace engineers, which is the fastest way to get rejected. The "AI accelerates, humans decide" positioning is perfect for enterprise adoption.
Using proven emergency management principles gives instant credibility. The span of control limits (3-7 agents) shows you understand coordination complexity.
The Critical Issues (Reality Check)
Token Costs Will Kill You at Scale
: Your own docs say multi-agent systems use 15x more tokens than single agents. At enterprise scale (hundreds of incidents/day), you're looking at:
Complex incident with 10+ agents: $10-50 (problematic)
P1 incident with full investigation: $100+ (deal-breaker)
: Most enterprises won't pay $50k/month for incident investigation when engineers can do it for "free" (sunk cost).
Implement aggressive token optimization DAY ONE
Use local models (Ollama) for 80% of operations
Only escalate to GPT-4/Claude for complex reasoning
Build cost predictors that estimate investigation cost BEFORE starting
Integration Complexity is Severely Underestimated
: You assume clean APIs for:
Prometheus/Grafana (often custom implementations)
GitHub Enterprise (behind VPNs, custom auth)
Confluence (API rate limits, poor search)
Slack (data retention policies)
PagerDuty (custom fields everywhere)
: Enterprise observability stacks are Frankenstein monsters. You'll spend 70% of implementation time on data source integration, not AI.
Build adapter pattern with pluggable connectors
Start with 3 PERFECT integrations, not 20 mediocre ones
Create "degraded mode" that works with missing data sources
Provide data source health dashboard
The "Engineers Will Just Use It" Assumption
: You assume engineers will naturally turn to COMPASS during incidents.
: During a P1 incident at 3 AM:
Opens Slack, Grafana, logs simultaneously
Starts running memorized queries
Calls teammate who "knows this system"
COMPASS? "I don't have time to learn a new tool right now"
Why They Won't Use It
: "I don't trust AI to understand our custom setup"
: "I can check these 3 things faster manually"
: "I need to SEE the actual metrics, not summaries"
: "If AI is wrong, I'm still responsible"
Embed INTO existing tools (Slack bot, Grafana panel)
Start as "second opinion" system running in parallel
Show value through shadow mode (what COMPASS would have found)
Build trust with weekly "COMPASS was right" reports
Security & Compliance Gaps
No mention of data residency requirements
No RBAC beyond basic multi-tenancy
No audit log encryption/signing
No PII/sensitive data handling
No SOC2 Type 2 compliance timeline
No discussion of prompt injection beyond "validation"
Enterprise Requirements You're Missing
Air-gapped deployment options
Bring-your-own-LLM-keys
Data sovereignty (EU/US/APAC)
Audit logs that stand up in court
Integration with enterprise SSO/SAML
Secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS)
The Performance/Latency Problem
: Parallel agents → Orchestrator → Synthesis → Human
LLM API latency: 2-5 seconds per call
5 agents × 3 rounds = 15 LLM calls minimum
Real time: 30-45 seconds BEST case
Add network latency, rate limits, retries: 60-90 seconds typical
: Engineers make 3-5 decisions in the time COMPASS generates one hypothesis.
Cache everything aggressively
Pre-compute common hypotheses
Stream partial results
"Fast path" for known patterns
The Extensibility Framework Needs Work
: Template-based agent creation
No versioning strategy for agents
No A/B testing framework
No gradual rollout mechanism
No performance benchmarking
No automated testing for custom agents
: They'll want to add 50+ custom agents for their specific stack, and your framework doesn't handle:
Dependency management
Version compatibility
Performance degradation
The Brutal Truth About Enterprise Adoption
What Enterprises Actually Want:
Immediate Time-to-Value
: Show value in Week 1, not Month 3
: Can't make incidents worse
: No surprise $10k AWS bills
: Team by team, service by service
: Easy to turn off if it fails
What You're Offering:
Complex Implementation
: Unpredictable, potentially massive
: Needs full integration to show value
: "Let AI investigate your incidents"
Recommendations for Enterprise Success
Start Narrower, Go Deeper
Instead of "all incidents," focus on:
Database Performance Issues ONLY
Become the absolute best at one thing
99% accuracy on connection pool issues
Then expand to slow queries, then locks, etc.
Build Trust Through Shadow Mode
Run COMPASS in parallel for 30 days
Generate weekly reports: "What COMPASS Would Have Found"
Show missed issues, faster diagnosis, prevented escalations
Let engineers opt-in when they see value
Radical Cost Transparency
Show running cost ticker during investigation
Cost estimate BEFORE starting
"Budget exceeded, switching to local model" notifications
Monthly cost per team/service dashboards
Enterprise-First Features
Audit log export to SIEM
Data residency controls
RBAC with fine-grained permissions
API rate limit management
Backup/restore capabilities
The Slack-First Strategy
Engineers live in Slack during incidents:
@compass investigate high API latency on payment-service
> Checking 4 hypotheses in parallel...
> [LIKELY] Database connection pool exhaustion (87% confidence)
> [UNLIKELY] Memory leak (12% confidence, metrics normal)
> View details: [link] | Estimated cost: $0.43
The "10x One Thing" Approach
Pick ONE scenario and make it 10x better than human investigation:
: Java application memory leaks
: Analyzes heap dumps, correlates with deployments, identifies leak source
: 5 minutes vs 2 hours of human analysis
: Every Java team wants COMPASS
Is It Feasible to Build?
it's 3x more complex than your current estimates. Integration hell, token costs, and performance will eat most of your development time.
Will Engineers Use It?
