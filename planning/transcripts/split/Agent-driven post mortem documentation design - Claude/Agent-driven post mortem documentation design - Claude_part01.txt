Incident investigation MCP application
I'd like to create some artefacts for the project around the tech post mortem process. I was thinking about how it would be really good for the agents to report on hypotheses that they disproved as part of the investigation, essentially doing the investigation in plain sight of the human, which I think is a really nice idea. So I want to include that as something in the design. This is important. Then I was thinking about how we could even have an agent that can write up a timeline of events, hypotheses that were investigated, the route the human took through the investigation, all this info and write it up into a post mortem. That sounds really useful. In order to build this feature I'd like to do some research and maybe create a PDF of our findings in how we can use an agent to write up post mortems.
Synthesized post-mortem design, planned research strategy, and PDF deliverable.
The user wants to create artifacts for the COMPASS project related to the tech post-mortem process. They have two key ideas:
Agents should report on hypotheses they disproved during investigation - doing the investigation "in plain sight" of humans
An agent that can write up a timeline of events, hypotheses investigated, the human's investigation route, and compile this into a post-mortem
They want to research this and create a PDF of findings on how to use an agent to write up post-mortems.
This is a great addition to the COMPASS system - it aligns well with the human-in-the-loop design and the scientific method approach that Ivan has been following. The transparency of showing disproved hypotheses is excellent for learning and trust.
First search the project knowledge for any existing post-mortem related information
Then do web research on best practices for post-mortems and AI-assisted documentation
Create a comprehensive PDF report on the findings
I should start with the project knowledge search to see what's already documented about post-mortems in COMPASS.
Excellent idea! Having agents transparently show their investigation process, including disproved hypotheses, really reinforces COMPASS's human-in-the-loop philosophy and builds trust. Plus, automating post-mortem generation could save hours of documentation work while ensuring nothing gets missed.
Let me research this thoroughly - I'll check our project knowledge first, then explore best practices for AI-assisted post-mortem generation, and compile everything into a comprehensive PDF.

Research Complete: AI-Assisted Post-Mortem Generation for COMPASS
I've completed comprehensive research and created a detailed PDF report on implementing AI-assisted post-mortem generation within the COMPASS system. The report incorporates your excellent ideas about transparent hypothesis investigation and automated documentation.
Key Research Findings Incorporated:
1. Transparent Hypothesis Investigation
Documents ALL hypotheses tested during investigation, including those disproved
Shows the complete investigation journey "in plain sight" of humans
Builds trust and accelerates learning by revealing dead ends and reasoning
2. Automated Post-Mortem Generation
AI can reduce post-mortem creation time by 67-90% by automatically collecting events, metrics, and metadata throughout incident lifecycles
LLMs analyze data to highlight key decisions and actions while identifying patterns across incidents
Systems like Datadog draft reports by automatically drawing from incident timelines, saving teams hours of reconstruction work
3. Timeline Reconstruction
Temporal event reconstruction accurately recreates event sequences by analyzing timestamps and metadata to detect anomalies, establish correlations, and reconstruct detailed incident chronologies
Correlates events from multiple sources (logs, metrics, human actions, agent observations)
Creates visual timelines showing investigation progression
4. Industry Best Practices
Avoiding hypothesis-first approaches that lead to confirmation bias - instead organizing information into timelines first
Maintaining transparency through controlled disclosure that safeguards privacy while keeping stakeholders informed throughout the investigation process

I've updated the project with two files specifically talking about issues with RCA, and I've included a couple of links below to explore. I really want this tool to help promote good incident practices. We're already looking at good investigations, based on sound scientific process, driven by the incident command system, but now I want to look at what happens after incidents. It's really important to learn from incidents. Other industries are more mature than tech, and these documents show that if we really want to learn and understand, we shouldn't focus on a root cause. Let's aim to help companies using this identify trends in contributing causes, and build a better learning culture.
Please review all this information, and your previous document, and let's update it all with this new approach in mind

Synthesized new RCA philosophy to reshape incident learning culture.
The user has added new project files about issues with Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and wants to shift the focus from finding a single root cause to identifying contributing causes and building a learning culture. They've provided two links to explore and want me to update the previous document with this new approach.
Let me first search the project knowledge for the new files about RCA issues, then explore the provided links, and then update our approach accordingly.
I'll review the new project files about RCA issues and explore the provided links to update our approach to focus on learning culture and contributing causes rather than single root causes.

Synthesized learning-focused incident practices to replace root cause analysis.
Great! I now have comprehensive information about:
Problems with RCA (from project documents and research):
The term promotes a flawed reductionist view
Real incidents have multiple, interacting contributing factors
RCA tends to produce weaker administrative solutions
Poor feedback loops and failure to aggregate learning
Focus on blame rather than learning
Contributing Causes Approach (from Martin Ottaway):
Engineers should focus on prevention, not blame
Use neutral terms like "contributing causes" or "causal factors"
Focus on identifying efficient prevention solutions
Provide nuanced discussion on prevention
Learning from Incidents Philosophy (from research):
Systems thinking approach - behavior and safety impacted by everyone in system
Multiple interacting contributing factors, not single root cause
Double-loop learning and organizational learning
Just culture prerequisite for learning
Focus on systemic improvements, not person-focused actions
Learning Teams vs RCA (from project document):
Learning teams generate more actions (7.5 vs 3.5)
57% system-focused vs 30% for RCA
Different culture - involve all staff, even those not in incident
Focus on system problems, not staff performance
Now I need to update our previous PDF document with this new understanding. Let me create an updated version that shifts from "root cause" to "contributing causes" and emphasizes learning culture.
I'll now create an updated version of our post-mortem generation document that incorporates this crucial shift from root cause analysis to contributing causes and learning culture.

Synthesized research findings to reshape incident learning framework.
Excellent! The updated PDF has been created successfully. Now I should provide a summary of the key changes and insights from our research.
Paradigm Shift Complete: From Root Cause to Learning Culture
I've completely updated our approach based on the compelling evidence against traditional Root Cause Analysis. The new document represents a fundamental shift in how COMPASS approaches incident investigation and post-mortem generation.
Key Research Findings Integrated:
1. The Problem with RCA (from your project documents):
RCA promotes a flawed reductionist view by implying a single root cause can be found, when incidents actually result from multiple interacting contributing factors
Evidence shows only 45-70% of RCA recommendations are ever implemented, and organizations show persistent "organizational forgetting" with recurring incidents
Learning Teams generate a median of 7.5 actions vs 3.5 for RCA, with 57% being system-focused versus only 30% for RCA
2. Contributing Causes Philosophy (from Martin Ottaway):
Engineers should focus on prevention rather than blame, using neutral terms like "contributing causes" or "causal factors" instead of the poorly-defined "root cause"
Prevention analysis should evaluate each cause on an efficiency level, identifying the most effective solutions rather than assigning blame
3. Systems Thinking & Learning Culture:
Patient safety incidents are caused by multiple, interacting contributing factors across the entire system, not just frontline actions
Premiummedicalprotection
Double-loop learning - not just fixing problems but questioning underlying assumptions - requires a just culture as prerequisite
Systems thinking using causal loop diagrams can explain systemic structures sustaining poor safety culture and identify effective interventions
Major Changes in Our Approach:
FROM → TO Transformations:
Root Cause → Contributing Causes (multiple interacting factors)
Blame Assignment → Learning Culture (prevention focus)
Linear Analysis → Systems Thinking (complex interactions)
Person-Focused → System-Focused (57% vs 30%)
Single Incidents → Pattern Recognition (aggregate learning)
Investigation Reports → Learning Artifacts (continuous improvement)
New Post-Mortem Structure:
The updated document now includes sections on:
Normal Work Description
- How work actually happens vs procedures
Contributing Causes Map
- Factors across all system levels
- ALL paths explored, including disproved ones
- How factors combined to breach safety
- Links to similar incidents
- Hierarchy of effectiveness
Questions for Reflection
- Promoting continued team learning
Learning Teams Methodology Benefits:
Involves ALL staff, not just those in the incident
Asks "What made sense at the time?" not "Why did you err?"
Creates open, learning-oriented culture vs defensive blame culture
Generates 114% more improvement actions
Systems Levels for Analysis:
Government/Regulatory
Organization Management
Human-System Interface
Equipment & Technology
Each level contains contributing factors that interact to create incident conditions.
Implementation Focus:
The new approach emphasizes:
- Teams must feel safe reporting failures
- All investigation paths visible, including dead ends
- Identifying recurring systemic vulnerabilities
Prevention Efficiency
- Prioritizing interventions by impact/cost ratio
- Speed from incident to implemented improvement
View your updated comprehensive report
This paradigm shift aligns COMPASS with modern safety science and positions it to truly learn from incidents rather than just document them. The focus on contributing causes and learning culture will help organizations build resilient systems that improve with each incident rather than repeating the same failures.

The first document contained a lot more detail about how to include this feature into compass than the first. Please now review the documents you've built as well as looking at the project doumentation and consider how best to add in this feature to the project. Would it require a re-architecture or is the project well set up to handle such changes? As I haven't started building anything yet, now is the time to make such changes. Please think about this carefully and provide your recommendation on how to handle this feature, and other feature changes like adding in new agents that handle new features, adding in new data sources, new MCP servers etc.
Evaluated COMPASS architecture and determined extensibility supports feature integration seamlessly.
Perfect! The project documentation shows that COMPASS has excellent architectural foundations for extensibility:
