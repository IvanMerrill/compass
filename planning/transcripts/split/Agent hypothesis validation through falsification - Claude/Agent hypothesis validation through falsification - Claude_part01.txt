Incident investigation MCP application
I'm thinking about agent behaviour when presenting hypotheses to a human. If there's a way for an agent to disprove a hypothesis before presenting to the human then it makes sense for the agent to keep attempting to disprove until they can't disprove any more. This improves the confidence level in the hypothesis. Don't wait for a human interaction to disprove something you can already disprove. When creating a hypothesis, an agent should consider (within reason) all the ways the disprove the hypothesis, then identify which ones can be achieved with the data, then try them. Only once this investigation is done is a hypothesis ready to be presented to a human. Otherwise it gets added as a disproved hypothesis, with detailed reasoning, and tracked. I think this will help the workflow. What do you think? Is this possible?
Validated feasibility of agent self-disproof methodology before human presentation.
This is a really thoughtful refinement to the COMPASS investigation workflow. Ivan is thinking about making the AI agents more rigorous in their hypothesis validation before presenting to humans. Let me break down what he's proposing:
Before presenting a hypothesis to a human, agents should attempt to disprove it themselves
They should identify all reasonable ways to disprove the hypothesis
They should determine which disproof methods are achievable with available data
Only after attempting these disproofs should they present the hypothesis
If disproven, the hypothesis gets tracked with detailed reasoning
This aligns really well with:
Scientific method (falsificationism - Popper's approach)
The OODA loop methodology already in COMPASS
Reducing noise for human operators
Improving signal-to-noise ratio in human-agent interactions
The emphasis on human-in-the-loop but AI-accelerated investigation
Let me think about the feasibility and implications:
Reduces cognitive load on human operators
Improves hypothesis quality (only high-confidence ones reach humans)
Creates a valuable knowledge base of disproven hypotheses (prevents repeated investigation of dead ends)
Aligns with "fail fast" principle
Makes better use of parallel agent execution
The disproved hypothesis tracking could become a learning mechanism
Challenges to consider:
Need to define "within reason" - how much effort/time/cost should an agent spend on disproof attempts?
Risk of agents going down rabbit holes if not constrained
Need to balance thoroughness vs speed (MTTR goals)
Some disproofs might require human judgment or access to systems agents don't have
Need clear criteria for when a hypothesis is "sufficiently tested"
Implementation considerations:
This fits naturally into the Observe phase of OODA
Could be part of the agent's reasoning framework
Needs cost controls (token usage, time limits)
Should have circuit breakers to prevent infinite loops
The disproved hypothesis tracking needs a structured format
Could use this for agent learning over time
I see a systematic approach to hypothesis testing that transforms how AI agents validate and present information. The workflow creates a structured method for rigorous investigation, ensuring only high-quality hypotheses reach human review. By building in self-critique and validation mechanisms, agents can dramatically improve the reliability and efficiency of their investigative processes.
refinement to the agent behavior model, and yes, it's absolutely possible. You're essentially embedding a mini scientific method loop into each agent's hypothesis generation process - implementing Popper's falsification principle before human escalation. This significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio for human operators.
Why This Works Well for COMPASS
Aligns with existing architecture:
Fits naturally into the Observe phase of your OODA loop
Leverages the parallel execution framework you're building
Complements the consensus mechanisms between agents
Supports the "human-in-the-loop for decisions, AI for acceleration" principle
Improves investigation quality:
Reduces cognitive load on operators (only high-confidence hypotheses reach them)
Prevents "hypothesis fatigue" where humans see too many weak theories
Creates a valuable knowledge base of
(often as important as what does)
Naturally prioritizes hypotheses by strength of evidence
Implementation Pattern
# 1. Generate potential disproofs
_generate_disproof_strategies
# 2. Filter to feasible ones
_filter_by_data_availability
# 3. Execute within constraints
# 4. Calculate confidence based on surviving attempts
_calculate_confidence
## Key Design Considerations
seconds per hypothesis validation?
Token budget per disproof attempt
taking longer than investigation
Test most likely disproofs first
Disproof strategy categories
Temporal contradiction
"This couldn't have caused that - wrong timeline"
Logical contradiction
"If X were true, Y would also be true, but Y is false"
"Metrics show opposite pattern"
"This explains only 5% of affected systems"
Alternative explanation
"This simpler hypothesis explains it better"
"hyp_db_connection_pool_exhausted"
"Connection pool exhaustion causing timeouts"
confidence_before_test
"Pool utilization at 45%, well below threshold"
"prometheus:pg_pool_stats"

## Benefits for Your MTTR Goals
Agents work in parallel on hypothesis validation
confidence hypotheses
forth "but did you check X
Systematic validation prevents tunnel vision
Disproved hypothesis tracking prevents repeated dead ends
Confidence scores help humans prioritize investigation paths
common disproofs become automatic checks
"This type of symptom is never caused by X"
Builds institutional knowledge from incident patterns
## Potential Challenges & Mitigations
Agent wastes time on exhaustive testing
Strict time/cost budgets per hypothesis
Some disproofs need human judgment
Mark these as "requires human validation"
Agent might disprove incorrectly
Log all reasoning; humans can review if suspicious
Slows down urgent incidents
Adaptive validation depth based on incident severity
## Integration with Your Current Architecture
This enhances your existing design without requiring major changes
etc.) each validate their own hypotheses
contributing to the shared blackboard
sees only validated hypotheses or clearly documented disproofs
get cleaner signal with confidence scores and validation history
Database Agent generates hypothesis
"Connection timeout spike caused by lock contention on orders table"
Before presenting to human
agent attempts disproofs
✓ Check if lock wait times increased → NO significant increase
lock contention would show in pg_locks metrics
Agent generates new hypothesis
"Connection timeout spike caused by network latency to database"
✓ Check network metrics → Latency increased 400% at incident time
✓ Check if isolated to DB connections → Yes
✓ Check if alternative explanation exists → No simpler explanation found
✓ VALIDATED - Confidence
Present to human with validation evidence attached.
This is absolutely feasible and a really smart evolution of your agent design.
It operationalizes the scientific method at the agent level while keeping humans in control of actual decisions. Want me to help you design the specific validation frameworks for each specialist agent type?
Let's start with providing this scientific framework as a foundation for all agents, so that every action is grounded in scientific reason, then move onto the specific validation Frameworks for each specialist. Keep extensibility in mind, new agents will always be to be created and we will want to fine tune all of this logic as we test so it needs to be accessible. I really want to base this project on good scientific reasoning. The ability to conduct high quality, auditable investigations that follow a rigourous investigative process automatically, with the application guiding the human, is a critical part of what I want to sell this product on. That it then does the post mortem is the real cherry on the cake
Architected scientific framework positioning rigorous, auditable investigations as core value.
This is a really powerful insight from Ivan. He's identified that the core value proposition isn't just speed - it's
rigorous, auditable, scientifically-grounded investigations
that happen automatically. This is about transforming incident response from an ad-hoc, tribal knowledge process into a systematic, repeatable, auditable scientific practice.
Key points he's emphasizing:
Scientific framework as foundation for ALL agents
Every action grounded in scientific reasoning
Extensibility - new agents will be created
Fine-tunable logic that's accessible
High quality, auditable investigations
Rigorous investigative process
Application guides the human
Post-mortem generation as additional value
This shifts the positioning from "AI speeds up incidents" to "AI brings scientific rigor to incident investigation" - which is actually much more compelling for enterprise buyers who need to justify why incidents happened, show compliance, and demonstrate continuous improvement.
A foundational scientific reasoning framework that all agents inherit
Make it extensible and configurable
Show how specialist agents extend the base framework
Emphasize auditability and traceability
Connect to the post-mortem generation
This should be structured, implementable code with TDD in mind.
powerful positioning shift
- you're not just selling speed, you're selling
scientific rigor and auditability
in incident response. Organizations often struggle to explain
an incident happened with confidence, and regulators/auditors want to see systematic investigation processes. COMPASS becomes the platform that transforms incident response from tribal knowledge and gut feel into documented, repeatable science.
Let me design the foundational scientific framework that all agents inherit.
Core Scientific Reasoning Framework
Creating the foundational scientific reasoning framework that all COMPASS agents will inherit. This provides the base for hypothesis-driven investigation, validation, and auditability.
compass_scientific_framework.py
Architected specialist agent implementations demonstrating framework extensibility.
Good, now let me create the specialist agent implementations that show how this framework extends to concrete agent types. I'll create one comprehensive example (Database Agent) and then show the pattern for others.
Now let me create an example specialist agent that extends this framework:

test_scientific_framework.py
Architected extensible template for specialist agent creation.
Now let me create a template for creating new specialist agents and a configuration guide to show how this is extensible.
Now let me create an extensible template for new agents and a configuration guide:
Creating a template for creating new specialist agents with comprehensive documentation on extensibility
compass_agent_template.py
Architected comprehensive documentation bridging extensibility, compliance, and investigative rigor.
Now let me create a comprehensive documentation file that explains the extensibility, configuration, and how this all ties into post-mortem generation and regulatory compliance.
Now let me create comprehensive documentation tying this all together:
Creating comprehensive documentation on the scientific framework, its extensibility, and how it enables auditability and post-mortem generation
COMPASS_SCIENTIFIC_FRAMEWORK_DOCS.md
Synthesized comprehensive framework integrating scientific rigor and extensible validation architecture.
Perfect! Now let me create a quick summary document that ties this all together and shows Ivan the complete picture of what we've built.
