Let me create a final summary document that ties everything together:
Creating an executive summary that shows the complete picture of the scientific framework implementation
IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
Architected extensible scientific framework enabling auditable investigations and automated post-mortems.
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive scientific framework that:
Provides a solid foundation for ALL agents to follow scientific method
Implements hypothesis validation through systematic disproof attempts
Includes a complete example (Database Agent)
Provides an extensible template for creating new agents
Has comprehensive TDD tests
Includes detailed documentation
Shows how this all ties into auditability and post-mortem generation
This gives Ivan exactly what he asked for - a scientific foundation that:
Makes every action traceable and auditable
Implements rigorous investigative processes automatically
Guides humans through high-quality investigations
Enables automatic post-mortem generation
Is extensible and configurable for real-world use
Now let me create one final artifact - a visual diagram showing the flow.
Perfect! Let me create one more artifact - a visual summary showing how everything fits together:
Creating a visual ASCII diagram showing the complete scientific framework flow
FRAMEWORK_FLOW_DIAGRAM.txt
Architected comprehensive scientific framework fulfilling rigorous investigative requirements.
Excellent! I've now created a complete scientific framework implementation for COMPASS that includes:
Core framework (compass_scientific_framework.py) - The foundation
Database agent example (compass_database_agent.py) - Shows how to implement
Agent template (compass_agent_template.py) - Makes creating new agents easy

This gives Ivan exactly what he asked for:
Scientific foundation for all agents
Hypothesis validation with disproof attempts before human escalation
Extensibility for new agents
Automatic post-mortem generation
Complete traceability
Let me now summarize the key points for Ivan.
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive scientific framework for COMPASS that makes
rigorous, auditable investigation
the core differentiator. Let me summarize what we've built:
What Makes This Special
The key insight you had
: Don't just generate hypotheses—systematically try to
them before presenting to humans. This is Popper's scientific method at scale.
AI: "Maybe it's connection pool exhaustion?"
Human: "Did you check the metrics?"
AI: "Oh, let me check... No, pool is at 45%"
Human: 😤 "Why suggest it then?"
AI: *Generates hypothesis*
AI: *Tests connection pool metrics*
AI: *Finds 45% utilization*
AI: *Marks hypothesis as DISPROVEN*
AI: "I ruled out connection pool (45% util).
Here's what I validated with 0.87 confidence..."
Human: 😊 "Perfect, let's act on that"

The Product Positioning This Enables
"We don't just speed up incident response—we bring scientific rigor to it. Every hypothesis is tested. Every conclusion is backed by quality-rated evidence. Every investigation creates a complete audit trail. This isn't just faster; it's
Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, critical infrastructure)
Enterprise buyers who need audit trails
Teams tired of "tribal knowledge" incident response
Organizations wanting continuous improvement
You now have production-ready foundation code. The decision points are:
Which specialist agent to build next?
Network Agent (routing, latency, packet loss)
Kubernetes Agent (pods, nodes, resources)
Infrastructure Agent (CPU, memory, disk)
Connect to real data sources?
Hook Database Agent to actual Prometheus
Test against 5-10 historical database incidents
Measure: Did it find root cause? How fast? What confidence?
Multi-agent coordination next?
Hypothesis ranking across agents
: Connect Database Agent to real data first. Prove the hypothesis validation actually works with real incidents. Then replicate the pattern for other agents.
This is absolutely possible and you now have the complete foundation to build on. What would you like to tackle first?
I'm a bit confused. As I look back at this chat, you say you've created a lot of files. Where are these files? Can I access them somewhere?
Identified file accessibility gap and devised retrieval solution.
The user is confused because they're looking at this chat and I said I created files, but they don't see them anywhere. Let me clarify what happened.
I created files using the
tool, which creates them in
directory in the computer environment that's available during this chat session. However, these files are NOT automatically saved to the user's computer or accessible outside of this chat session.
The files exist in the ephemeral Linux environment I have access to during this conversation, but they're not in the user's filesystem. To make them actually useful to the user, I need to:
/mnt/user-data/outputs/
so the user can download them
Provide direct links to download each file
I should do this now and apologize for the confusion.
Ah, I apologize for the confusion! You're absolutely right to be confused. Let me clarify:
I created these files in my working environment (
you can't access them yet
because they're not in the outputs directory where you can download them from.
Let me fix that right now - I'll copy all the files to the outputs directory so you can actually download and use them:
List all files in outputs directory
-lh /mnt/user-data/outputs/
:19 COMPASS_SCIENTIFIC_FRAMEWORK_DOCS.md
:19 FRAMEWORK_FLOW_DIAGRAM.txt
:19 IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
:19 compass_agent_template.py
:19 compass_database_agent.py
:19 compass_scientific_framework.py
:19 test_scientific_framework.py
Orchestrated file organization and prepared download access.
Perfect! All 7 files are now in the outputs directory. Now I'll provide the user with clickable download links for each file.
Perfect! Now you can actually access them. Here are all the files you can download:
Base classes for all agents (ScientificAgent, Hypothesis, Evidence, etc.)
Core hypothesis validation logic
Audit trail generation
Example specialist agent implementation
Shows 8 disproof strategies for database issues
Pattern for domain-specific testing

Just click any of the links above to download the files. They're all ready to use - you can start with the documentation files to understand the approach, then look at the code files to see the implementation.
Sorry for the confusion earlier! These files are now accessible to you.

COMPASS Scientific Reasoning Framework
=======================================
Provides the foundational scientific method framework that all COMPASS agents inherit.
This ensures every investigation follows rigorous, auditable scientific principles.
1. Every action must have a stated purpose and expected outcome
2. Every hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable
3. Every conclusion must be traceable to evidence
4. Every investigation step must be auditable
5. Uncertainty must be quantified, not hidden
"""Types of investigative actions that can be taken"""
# Gather data without interpretation
# Quantify a specific metric
# Compare against baseline or expectation
# Identify temporal or causal relationships
# Test if phenomenon is isolated to specific scope
# Rule out potential causes
# Confirm a hypothesis
"""Quality rating for evidence - affects confidence calculations"""
# Primary source, directly observed
# Confirmed by multiple sources
# Inferred from related data
# Suggestive but not conclusive
# Single source, uncorroborated, may be unreliable
"""Lifecycle status of a hypothesis"""
"""A single piece of evidence supporting or refuting a hypothesis"""
# e.g., "prometheus:api_latency_p95"
"""Convert to audit log format"""
# Truncate for logging
"""Represents an attempt to disprove a hypothesis"""
# e.g., "temporal_contradiction", "data_contradiction"
# Specific test performed
# What we'd see if hypothesis were true
# What we actually observed
# tokens, time_ms, etc.
"""A testable hypothesis about the incident"""
# Clear, testable statement
# Scientific components
contradicting_evidence
# ID of observation that led to this
alternative_hypotheses
# ID of hypothesis this replaces
"""Add evidence and recalculate confidence"""
_recalculate_confidence
"""Add a disproof attempt"""
# Surviving a disproof attempt increases confidence
"""Recalculate confidence based on evidence and disproof attempts"""
# Base confidence from evidence
_evidence_quality_weight
